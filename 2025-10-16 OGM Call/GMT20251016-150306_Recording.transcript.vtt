1
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.329
Jerry Michalski: This is the.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.770
Mike Nelson: I think there were a few women on there, too, which surprised me.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.300
Stacey Druss: Not surprising me.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.049
Jerry Michalski: the group chat. Oh, good. This is the Open Global Mind weekly call for October 16th, 2025.

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.879
Jerry Michalski: We were just bantering a little bit.

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:36.079
Jerry Michalski: Dave and I have been in for the week, and Dave, I have to apologize, I haven't been able to make your sessions, because they've overlapped with stuff. We've been part of a Sketch Your Mind virtual workshop all week that a Hungarian friend, Jolt Vichyan.

7
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.640
Jerry Michalski: decided to throw, and it's been great. It's been really, like…

8
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.340
Jerry Michalski: I found it super useful, like, I got to do a brain demo session on Tuesday morning.

9
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.699
Jerry Michalski: Dave, I don't know if you have any thoughts about it, but…

10
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.419
Dave Gray: I thought it was great, and it was well received, I think.

11
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:12.970
Jerry Michalski: And it's… what's nice is he's attracted a good who's who of people who care about visualization and graphic facilitation and thinking with pictures, and aces like Dave, who've been putting concepts into visuals for years and years and years and years and years, and it's collaborative.

12
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.320
Jerry Michalski: there's a very nice… there's a very nice feel to it. We're, you know, kind of attending one another's sessions and on from there.

13
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.710
Jerry Michalski: I will put a link to the…

14
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.670
Jerry Michalski: the conference in the chat. Sketch Your Mind is the name of it.

15
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.549
Jerry Michalski: And, I'll put a link to it in the chat.

16
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.450
Jerry Michalski: And then…

17
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:46.449
Jerry Michalski: Off we go. And then, Stacy, I wanted to mention to you that I just recorded… I just recorded a podcast, about masculinity with, Mo Carrick. I'll put a link to her,

18
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.139
Jerry Michalski: her bio, her LinkedIn, in the chat as well.

19
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.369
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I met her when I was in Berkeley at the Responsive Conference, and we had a really delightful conversation about…

20
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.109
Jerry Michalski: all aspects about masculinity, so I'm gonna do… I have to do some very, very light editing on it, and then post that.

21
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.379
Stacey Druss: Thank you. Look forward to that.

22
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.530
Jerry Michalski: And maybe, I mean, a good idea might be to… I'll post that, and then we can have that as a topic for an OGM call.

23
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.090
Stacey Druss: I like that.

24
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.690
Jerry Michalski: See how that goes.

25
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.359
Jerry Michalski: Groovy. Nice to see everybody here. I, sent… I was inspired,

26
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.909
Jerry Michalski: For this topic, just by recent news, and… and…

27
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:38.759
Jerry Michalski: And by kind of an awareness that generally, but not exclusively or entirely, this is a left-leaning group. We sort of have attracted like-minds.

28
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:52.720
Jerry Michalski: And some of us are more toward the middle, but very few of us are out on the right wing of political opinion these days. And when things happen, we tend to have a similar response. And, I was struck recently that,

29
00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.840
Jerry Michalski: through bluster and force and I don't know what else, other kinds of things, Donald Trump seems to have cracked some code.

30
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.470
Jerry Michalski: on the Gaza situation, and achieved a ceasefire and an exchange of hostages, which ends the hostage problem for the moment.

31
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:29.820
Jerry Michalski: There are no remaining October 7 hostages that we know of, alive or dead. I guess maybe some of the bodies have yet to be recovered and returned, but in general, that thing is resolved. How Gaza plays out, we don't know. If Trump has his way, it'll turn into a resort city with, you know, large Trump towers on it, a thought that chills my blood, but hey, there.

32
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.999
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: He seems to have dropped… he seems to have dropped that.

33
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.680
Jerry Michalski: I… maybe.

34
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.489
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You must never know anything with him, yeah.

35
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.820
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, he's apparently also got plans, on his, in the Oval Office, he's got mock-ups of a new Arc of Triumph kind of thing opposite,

36
00:03:45.970 --> 00:04:00.670
Jerry Michalski: Opposite Arlington National Cemetery across the river, and he's adding stuff like the ballroom and other sorts of things to the White House, gilding it all in gold, etc. He's leaving his mark. He's absolutely leaving his mark. But I'm straying from our topic.

37
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:12.039
Jerry Michalski: in a way that I don't particularly want to, because I kind of want to… I'll come back to it. Then I heard the news that I didn't realize, but that the recent, the,

38
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.209
Jerry Michalski: the Nobel… the Nobel Peace Prize winner,

39
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:23.819
Jerry Michalski: Maria Corina Machado, dedicated her Nobel Prize to the people of Venezuela and Donald Trump.

40
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:35.299
Jerry Michalski: And I sort of googled that, and I saw… well, I googled that, and I saw an article from The Nation that was like, oh my god, what a sellout, this is terrible, blah blah blah, and then I heard some backstory.

41
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.849
Jerry Michalski: And the backstory I heard, which I'll share here, which is Google-able also, if you're looking for it.

42
00:04:42.050 --> 00:05:00.849
Jerry Michalski: was that Trump is the only president who has actually sent, like, Navy offshore, and started to actively do stuff that is helpful to people against Maduro. He's put a $40 million bounty on Maduro's head. Whether that's even legal in the world, I don't know.

43
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:18.250
Jerry Michalski: likely that it's not, but somehow or other, through… and the reason that Machado dedicates their award to him is he has actually done something and moved the needle. And sometimes you move the needle by scratching the record.

44
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.570
Jerry Michalski: I don't know, I'm stretching the metaphor.

45
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.230
Jerry Michalski: But…

46
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.589
Jerry Michalski: I'm left-leaning, and I was like, how do I process this? How do I handle this? And I'd like us not to talk about

47
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.509
Jerry Michalski: Trump and Machado and this particular incident, but rather.

48
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:50.950
Jerry Michalski: other instances of hearing stuff that conflicts with our worldview, and figuring out, do we shift our worldview some? What do we do? How do we do that? I'd rather focus there than on the incident, although I will understand if we need to spend some time decompressing.

49
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.560
Mike Nelson: the inside.

50
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.830
Jerry Michalski: right now. So, Gil.

51
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.159
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, so the topic for today is shifting one's worldview?

52
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:10.479
Jerry Michalski: No, the topic is just, dealing with uncomfortable news, which taps into shifting one's worldview, but it's just like, how do we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview, is maybe the generalization of the topic.

53
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:25.940
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Got it. Good topic, and plenty of opportunity for that these days. Just on the immediate one, and maybe this is a good jumping-off point, I don't… I'm not of the mind that someone should get the Nobel Peace Prize for putting warships off somebody's coast.

54
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:44.620
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: kind of doesn't fit my picture of a Nobel Peace Prize. On the other hand, I'm… I'm cautiously impressed with what Trump has done in the Middle East, but I also don't think that somebody should get the Nobel Peace Prize for starting an initiative. I don't think Obama should have gotten it when he did.

55
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.290
Jerry Michalski: Obama, the Peace Prize he got seems complete…

56
00:06:47.290 --> 00:07:07.170
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No, it was performative, and I don't think Trump should… deserves it now, but he might well deserve it in a year, if this thing holds. Yeah, and that's… and that challenges my pictures of a bumbling, narcissistic, you know, baby guy. Kimmel's been reaming him beautifully every night, and really brilliant work going on there.

57
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.529
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But that doesn't mean that he can't do some things successfully and well.

58
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.909
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And it may be that just the character that he brings to it was very different than Biden's.

59
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:29.179
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: could generate movement in the Middle East that nobody else could. So, cautiously optimistic there. Big change in my worldview, because I have him on the neg list for everything, except now.

60
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.350
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: One thing's moved over. Maybe. Maybe.

61
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:41.660
Jerry Michalski: Maybe, maybe, maybe. Okay, good. So I want to loosen up that part of the topic. My buddy Al Chang, who always says wise things and always thinks differently than I do, but we can talk really, really well.

62
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:51.660
Jerry Michalski: Said a while ago that it's as if there's this set of facts on the ground, and the left and the right are seeing roughly the same fact, roughly.

63
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.460
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Mmm.

64
00:07:52.460 --> 00:08:05.140
Jerry Michalski: But roughly the same facts, but have a completely different movie script around them, a totally different narrative. But the narratives are relatively consistent and work. And the two sides can't see or read

65
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:14.820
Jerry Michalski: each other's narratives. They're incapable, and this is… this is… I'm paraphrasing Al Badley, but… but he really kind of made me slow down a little bit, and think, how do I steal man?

66
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:29.850
Jerry Michalski: the opposing narrative. How do I actually put my brain into it and listen for those different parts? So when Trump was like, I've stopped eight wars, I used Claude and ChatGPT to say, hey, what has… and Trump has actually… he has sent his people…

67
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:44.419
Jerry Michalski: all over the place to do stuff, and he claimed credit for India-Pakistan, which infuriated Modi and is stupid, but the other things that he claims to have done, he's actually been, like, on the ground… not him, on the ground. His people have been doing stuff that hasn't been done before.

68
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:55.859
Jerry Michalski: And that's very interesting to me, because he gives a damn about, like, you know, making a mark in foreign policy with his particular imprimatur. Anyway, Mike.

69
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:07.419
Mike Nelson: I don't know where to go exactly, but let me start by just saying that the commentary about the Nobel Peace Prize was.

70
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.999
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: She said it's dedicated.

71
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.889
Mike Nelson: to the people of Venezuela, and that she thanks

72
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.119
Mike Nelson: Trump. I don't think… I don't think she used the word dedicated it.

73
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.740
Jerry Michalski: I got the quote, it's dedicated. It's, oops, let me see where I've…

74
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.939
Jerry Michalski: How did I… I'll find it.

75
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.169
Mike Nelson: Well, most of the quotations have been sort of two-phase, but anyway…

76
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.769
Jerry Michalski: So here, let me read it.

77
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:37.610
Mike Nelson: The fact is, is that she's in a bind. She has to be as obsequious as possible.

78
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:52.790
Jerry Michalski: That's a way of reading it. But listen to this. I dedicate the last sentence of a long post on X. I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause, exclamation point.

79
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.589
Mike Nelson: Well, the first round, and she actually, I think she actually called him up.

80
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.580
Mike Nelson: And so… you know.

81
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.200
Jerry Michalski: call.

82
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.910
Mike Nelson: Yeah, but again, it's… If you're in her position.

83
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.680
Mike Nelson: And you've got somebody who's angry that he doesn't have the Peace Prize, and you need his help.

84
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:21.110
Mike Nelson: I mean, whether those words reflect what she really believes is what I'm saying. But the other thing I wanted to say is that,

85
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.070
Mike Nelson: I've been using the phrase cosplay diplomacy.

86
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.379
Mike Nelson: Over and over again.

87
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:37.689
Mike Nelson: Because that's what we're seeing. I mean, these claims that he somehow reconciled or stopped a fight between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

88
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:44.900
Mike Nelson: I mean… It's… these are temporary things that are happening, but…

89
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:52.329
Mike Nelson: let's wait 5 years and look back, and particularly with Gaza. I mean, Gaza, he says he has a deal.

90
00:10:52.630 --> 00:11:00.380
Mike Nelson: And maybe in the New York City real estate sense of the word deal, he has a deal where, okay.

91
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.169
Mike Nelson: We've got a common goal, and now let's figure out the details.

92
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.029
Mike Nelson: But no diplomat.

93
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:12.779
Mike Nelson: Would claim that what Hamas said they would half agree to.

94
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:24.029
Mike Nelson: is a final deal. I mean, it's already falling apart. So, in many ways, this is like the way that Trump ended the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.

95
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:32.560
Mike Nelson: He didn't talk to the Afghan government, he talked to the Taliban, and they got a deal, which was completely vague, and didn't have any

96
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:40.600
Mike Nelson: Any checks, any way of making sure both parties did their, did their, fulfilled their piece of the deal.

97
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.130
Mike Nelson: And for his convenience, He set it up so that

98
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.340
Mike Nelson: The withdrawal happened after he was out of office.

99
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:58.790
Mike Nelson: And Biden got to have all this egg on his face because of an incompetent deal that Trump and his team had agreed to.

100
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:08.000
Mike Nelson: And I really worry that if you've got a deal with Hamas that says they will disarm, but they explicitly said, we didn't agree to that part of the deal.

101
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.160
Mike Nelson: But he still thinks he deserves a Peace Prize.

102
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:20.959
Mike Nelson: But let me get… let me… let me change topics to a third thing that, is very personal, and that is, two days ago.

103
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:30.750
Mike Nelson: I got some incredibly… unforeseen, incredible… outrageous Very upsetting news.

104
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.820
Mike Nelson: about one of my favorite colleagues here at Carnegie, and some of you may have seen this story.

105
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:45.139
Mike Nelson: We have one of the very top analysts who studies Indian military and geopolitics.

106
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:54.849
Mike Nelson: And his house was raided recently by the FBI, and they found more than a thousand top-secret and confidential documents.

107
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.800
Mike Nelson: And, you know, he's been an advisor to the State Department, he knows full well how to handle classified documents.

108
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:09.940
Mike Nelson: But it's, you know, it's leading to all sorts of stories about, is he a spy for the Chinese? He hasn't been accused of that, but…

109
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.150
Mike Nelson: It's…

110
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:20.339
Mike Nelson: It's just astonishing that someone… if this is true, how could someone so smart and so, experienced be so stupid?

111
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.489
Mike Nelson: It's a little bit like Sandy Berger.

112
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.050
Mike Nelson: Clinton's National Security Advisor.

113
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:33.099
Mike Nelson: Who went to the archives and decided to take a couple documents and stuff them in his pants and walk out the door.

114
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:45.040
Mike Nelson: But on a much larger scale. And so, again, I mean, this was just… it's a complete disconnect from everything I know about this scholar, and it makes no sense, and…

115
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.560
Mike Nelson: I'm having a very hard time dealing with it. I don't know how I will.

116
00:13:50.640 --> 00:14:02.300
Jerry Michalski: Thank you very much for offering up a completely different example of this thing going on, because that's what I'd love to focus on, is how do we handle unwelcome, ill-fitting news in our worldview.

117
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:10.330
Jerry Michalski: And do we allow our worldviews to be permeable to things like that, or not, or how, or, like, what's that… what's that juncture?

118
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.369
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

119
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.910
Jerry Michalski: Alright, Kevin, please.

120
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.680
Jerry Michalski: You took your hand down, but you… oh, there you go.

121
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:28.999
Kevin Jones: Yeah, you know, so this is actually the opposite of that. I've got some surprisingly great news I don't know how to put together.

122
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:43.540
Kevin Jones: Some people know, you know, our house was rendered uninhabitable, and 1 in 6 houses in our low-status neighborhood, that's one another, were rendered either destroyed or uninhabitable, about 400 houses.

123
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:52.570
Kevin Jones: And we've been asked to do a housing fund for the folks, and most of the Latino folks moved there because it was the cheapest place in the county.

124
00:14:52.650 --> 00:15:09.310
Kevin Jones: And, we're starting to work with the community on it, and they're really a lot of credibility, and we got an outreach this week through my son, and we're gonna have 25 old-order Mennonite carpenters working… living on our farm, and they're self-contained, you know.

125
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:16.349
Kevin Jones: trucks and whatever they do. They're gonna, build houses for free from May

126
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:23.699
Kevin Jones: through, no, November through May, and I want to do it again, next year. And,

127
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:30.649
Kevin Jones: They're also going to leave behind a 30 by 40 foot, what is going to be their, mess hall.

128
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:46.490
Kevin Jones: eating room, whatever, behind this building, and they're gonna rehab our house for free. You know, do the… at least the sheetrock and the, the, insulation and stuff. We have to decide, you know, if it's a…

129
00:15:46.700 --> 00:16:04.460
Kevin Jones: it becomes an Airbnb, you don't need the large mudroom that we had for 5 people, so you have to do some other things. But it's just amazingly, surprisingly good. You know, they're gonna clean it up, and they're gonna fix the house for free, and they're gonna build about 20 houses for free. So, you know, our…

130
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.890
Kevin Jones: Our raise for our fund.

131
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:20.310
Kevin Jones: It went down by, you know, the labor on 20 houses is not… no longer in our math for the first year. So it's like, well, you know, sometimes things happen like that, too. I just need to, you know.

132
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:31.449
Kevin Jones: Sometimes there are days like that, where everything… I'll do a brief thing, I was taking my son on a college trip, he's 407 now, so whatever, but we,

133
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:43.230
Kevin Jones: we were flying upstate New York to BART, I think it was, and we got upgraded to first class, and we got, you know, champagne or whatever in the morning, and then we got to the hotel.

134
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:58.800
Kevin Jones: And it was apparently closed, but there was this massive Samoan guy working on the phones. He said, just grab a key, and nobody ever came, so we sampled single moths from their deck that, you know, that was my first sampling of single moths.

135
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:05.859
Kevin Jones: we went to the movie Smoke, and they said, oh, we're through taking tickets, just go inside. So I told them, I said, look, you know.

136
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:21.269
Kevin Jones: sometimes there are days like this, you know? And so, you know, suddenly, you know, 25 to 30 older… and they wear straw hats, and they get driven around, and they'll bring some horse-drawn things, but they have, you know, they have people drive their…

137
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:28.649
Kevin Jones: their semi-trailer with all their tools, they use power tools, but it's just like, you know, sometimes things happen like that, I just need to say.

138
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.150
Jerry Michalski: Happy to hear, happy news around Swanoa, thank you.

139
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.899
Kevin Jones: Yeah, stitching together all these new resources is going to be really complicated. I need people who are…

140
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:46.180
Kevin Jones: much better at figuring out how to handle that than I am. And there are people around, so…

141
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.760
Jerry Michalski: Love that.

142
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:49.519
Jerry Michalski: Gil, please.

143
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.850
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

144
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.940
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Kevin, why is that a challenge to your worldview?

145
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.760
Kevin Jones: Why as what?

146
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.629
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Why is all that good stuff that's happened a challenge to your worldview, given that that's the thing.

147
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:21.590
Kevin Jones: Oh, it doesn't… no, sometimes things happen like that, it's just then you have to deal with this, you know, surprising abundance requires lots of coordination, you know? That's… I mean, you know, it would require lots of coordination. It doesn't challenge… no, it challenges the world in here, saying, let's think about bad things. I was saying, no, let's think about good things, too.

148
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.760
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: deal. I love it.

149
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:29.690
Jerry Michalski: Jerry, by the way, could you raise the gain on your mic? You're much softer than everybody else. Oh, interesting.

150
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.150
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: questions here.

151
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.760
Jerry Michalski: Pushed over to this, to this mic.

152
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.150
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: With your fancy new mic.

153
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.340
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, no.

154
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:44.920
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Couple of things. Back on the Machado thing, it seems that obsequiousness is one of the required things with this president, and if you've watched a cabinet meeting, you know, you can see that in full cringe.

155
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:45.880
Stacey Druss: Bomb.

156
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.449
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Seems to be a necessary part of any conversation.

157
00:18:48.450 --> 00:19:06.349
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Back to what you're saying, Jerry, about… about left and right seeing the same facts and developing different interpretations. You know that I'm… excuse me, I'm big on interpretations. I'm not big on facts these days. I think we live in interpretations, and that's part of the currency of human affairs and where it gets really interesting.

158
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.699
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But part of the challenge right now is that left and right are not seeing the same facts.

159
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:20.399
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Folks are in deep, deep bubbles, not even being exposed to the same information, things that we think are obvious, you know, folks who are living on Fox never see.

160
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.859
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And vice versa. So it's a whole other layer of challenge.

161
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:40.830
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: to how we have reasonable conversations when we're just looking at, you know, utterly same detail. In personal terms, I found that happening with me around the whole Gaza situation over the last 3 or 4 months, where I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking clue.

162
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.690
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Of what was going on there.

163
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:59.240
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't trust Hamas and the Gaza Health Ministry or news services or anything like that. I don't trust the Israeli government's information. I don't trust the UN. And I try to piece together stories from anomalous reports that contradict each other.

164
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:07.119
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: from people who aren't there, and I'm not there, and it's very strange for me to come to the conclusion that I really don't know what happened.

165
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:16.510
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I'm happy to go into detail about that. I've done some numerical analysis, excuse me, of some of the data that's been reported, and things just don't cohere.

166
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.030
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: From what I can see. And it's forced a kind of humility on me.

167
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.700
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That's really unfamiliar.

168
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:29.419
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm used to being able to, you know, look at a bunch of complex information and draw a conclusion that I have some confidence in.

169
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:39.849
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And can't, in that case. So, double layer, not seeing the same facts, and, you know, mix-up facts that don't fit together.

170
00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.010
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Makes this even more challenging.

171
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.160
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Gil. Is my voice a little louder? I found the gain and turned it up.

172
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.370
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It's better now, thanks.

173
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.650
Jerry Michalski: Is it loud enough? Should I turn it up more?

174
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.219
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Somebody else say something.

175
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.520
Jerry Michalski: We're good?

176
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.989
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No, let's have somebody else say something comparable.

177
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.599
Jerry Michalski: Oh, somebody else too.

178
00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.620
Jerry Michalski: compare levels.

179
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.689
Mike Nelson: Sounds good to me, Jerry.

180
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:01.819
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Sounds fine, Jerry.

181
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.129
Jerry Michalski: Okay, good. Thank you for… Gil, thank you very much for pointing that out.

182
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:21.370
Jerry Michalski: On the point of not seeing the same facts, I want to complexify that a little bit, if I can borrow Adam Grant's, term. There's a book out, called Progressive Myths, I'll put a link to it in the chat, and I only know about it because my buddy Sammy Michaelonin.

183
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:26.060
Jerry Michalski: Finn, who lives in Melbourne, wrote a review about it.

184
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:41.759
Jerry Michalski: And, he said, this… and I'm just realizing this moment that this is a reason for the topic that we're on right now, is that this was in the back of my head, and I hadn't realized that, you know, I didn't connect it to the Gaza news. And…

185
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.139
Jerry Michalski: Apparently, in this book.

186
00:21:44.760 --> 00:22:03.379
Jerry Michalski: a lot of what hap- which I've not read, a lot of what happens is the taking apart of situations where left and right disagree, and seeing that the situations are more complicated than you thought they were. That it isn't black and white, that it isn't this or that. And from my conversation with Al.

187
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:15.709
Jerry Michalski: I think… I think the left sees… I think a lot of the left believes that the right isn't even seeing things that happened, when what's happening sometimes, sometimes on the right is they're seeing the incident.

188
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:24.590
Jerry Michalski: But they're gathering different information about it and seeing it with a different lens or a different disaggregation of components. I don't know exactly how to say it.

189
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:33.050
Jerry Michalski: And since I haven't read the book, I don't know the details in it. But that's a piece of what I'm aiming for is, hey, how do we…

190
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:44.269
Jerry Michalski: Might we be able to have more interesting conversations about things that have happened if we allowed the complexity to show up in this space, and the possibility that

191
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.539
Jerry Michalski: the other side isn't completely stupid and evil. Which, which, I hear a lot.

192
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:58.210
Jerry Michalski: like, really. Years ago, in 2015, I think this was before the 2016 election.

193
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:16.710
Jerry Michalski: April and I visited some dear family friends who live in Boulder, and we had a friendly political conversation in which I said, Trump is actually sort of smarter than people think he is. And there was no synonym for smart that I could use that would make them go, oh, okay, we sort of agree. So we had a little bet going, and it turned into a funny thing.

194
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:35.950
Jerry Michalski: But, you know, smart like a mafia Don, maybe? I don't know, but it's some sort of intelligent, because nobody survives 91 federal indictments, and winds up running the world and, you know, closing a deal in Gaza, who is an idiot. Like, I don't see how you can just be lucky enough to do that.

195
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:52.629
Jerry Michalski: And I'll put a link to my… in fact, I created some videos during the pandemic about Trump. I created a field manual around Donald Trump. It's 6 videos. I'll just put a link to the playlist, and the very first one is, Trump is Smarter Than People Think.

196
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.300
Jerry Michalski: Right?

197
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.429
Jerry Michalski: And it's hard to say. And so I'm trying to figure out

198
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:17.300
Jerry Michalski: how do we not make the situations black and white, and like, oh my god, when they do hateful things, like boast that they have to be given a Nobel Peace Prize, what person in their right mind does that? Like, nobody goes and says, you must give me this award, I deserve… like, that's…

199
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:31.959
Jerry Michalski: well, okay, maybe that's just this guy's style. And there are things that Trump and his minions have done which are horrifying and are hurting… are harming people, and I am, like, dramatically opposed to those, but I…

200
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:43.889
Jerry Michalski: I'm trying to find words to say, how do we not look at all of this and say, there's nothing in here that we can talk about, or that we can agree on, or that whatever else? So…

201
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.280
Jerry Michalski: Gil, please.

202
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.369
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Somebody can be both smart and not in their right mind.

203
00:24:53.270 --> 00:25:04.440
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: somebody can be smart about certain things and stupid about other things. Somebody can be, you know, can be effective in certain ways and, ineffective in other ways. And this guy is complicated.

204
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:14.249
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And that's part of the challenge here. You know, again, I don't think we're seeing the same facts. I sometimes hop between MSNBC and Fox News in the evening.

205
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.150
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And you'd think they're on different planets.

206
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:33.769
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: the story's just, you know, covered on one, not covered at all on the other. Not just covered differently, but just not covered at all. Things that we might think totally important, not there all week on Fox. So, there's that as kind of one of the bases of it.

207
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:43.229
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But I hear… I hear and really resonate, Jerry, with what you're saying, because we're… there's a tendency

208
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:55.609
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I don't think this is left or right, maybe it's modern capitalist culture of really polarizing and calling things black and white that are complex and, you know, washing out nuance.

209
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:11.299
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And, yeah, and it's part of the mess that we're in. I've shared before a friend I've made on the MAGA ride, introduced by a mutual friend who we both love and trust, and

210
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.380
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We had a fascinating first conversation.

211
00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.849
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: ostensibly, it was gonna be about climate, and I was gonna change his mind about things, and

212
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:31.299
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: discovered him changing my mind about things around supply-side economics and other stuff. We came out of that conversation loving each other. We're still friends. We still disagree.

213
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:41.300
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We have changed each other, you know, we sometimes… we occasionally agree in surprising ways, and often don't, but we found a way to have that different kind of conversation that you're talking about.

214
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:48.259
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm just back from the Sustainable Brands Conference in San Diego, and one of the presentations on

215
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:55.210
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Monday was from a guy named Bill Shireman, who's a longtime friend of mine, who's probably my favorite Republican environmentalist.

216
00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.950
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And

217
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:11.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: used to, used to organize with Nader, around, the California Bottle Bill, and parted ways on other political issues. Bill did a presentation about how to talk to MAGA.

218
00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:24.419
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And one of the things he did, one of the… one of the pieces that stood out was he set up a pair of slides of four MAGA people and four progressive people, and said, look, you know, these sides are not at all the same.

219
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:32.220
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, on the Republican side, you've got, you know, you've got Bannon, and you've got Pence, and you've got Alex Jones, and you've got, whoever, Mike Johnson.

220
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:40.559
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Not all the same people, not all the same thinking, analyses, political positions, and so forth, but we lump them. And you can do the same thing on the left.

221
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.920
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And it's very easy to, you know, to… to…

222
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.110
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Humans seem to love to categorize.

223
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:59.089
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We love to take shades of gray, as Dave might talk about, and try to, you know, try to delineate them and put them into boxes, and say, this is this and not that.

224
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:15.460
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And real often in the physical world, it's not that way, even around things like shades of gray and colors. You know, we've talked about the color maps that are red and named differently in different cultures. You know, what I will call blue, someone in Japan will call green.

225
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.210
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So how do we have a conversation?

226
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.740
Jerry Michalski: And Russian apparently has 4 different words for blue, yeah.

227
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:23.790
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So,

228
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:32.659
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So this is… this is really important territory, and it's very challenging, and we're in a culture that doesn't support the kind of conversation that you're proposing that we have.

229
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.170
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Gil. Yeah.

230
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.550
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We're… whoop…

249
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.379
Stacey Druss: Oh, wow. Can you tell me what… I'm.

250
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.090
Jerry Michalski: career.

251
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.389
Stacey Druss: Chatham House rules there. You tell me what.

252
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:23.920
Jerry Michalski: Chatham House is an organization in England, and when you say something is under Chatham House rules, it means you, everything that's said under this meeting

253
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:43.970
Jerry Michalski: which cannot be identified with the speaker. You can't say, so-and-so said this. You can, my understanding under Chatham House is, you can write about what got said, you just can't attribute it to anybody without their agreement. So if you need to quote… if Kevin said something that you want to write about in an article, you'd have to contact Kevin, get his approval to say Kevin said it.

254
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.069
Jerry Michalski: But I believe you can still say someone said X.

255
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.860
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yes.

256
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:58.710
Mike Nelson: But you can't reveal who was there, because sometimes saying that this was said will be immediately linked to the one person in the room who would have said it.

257
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:17.239
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, and I… Jerry, I was not clear about this for a long time. I was very surprised when I first discovered that OGM was being posted to YouTube, because I had talked about very personal things in these meetings that I assumed were just among us. So, the ground rules should be made more clear, especially if there's new people coming in.

258
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:23.609
Doug Breitbart: It just… I have a question, because I think in the posting to YouTube.

259
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.490
Doug Breitbart: The chat is not shared, it's just the video, correct?

260
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:32.190
Jerry Michalski: I don't post the chat on YouTube, but I do make the chat very available.

261
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:39.380
Doug Breitbart: Right. But I mean, in terms of this particular session, and Kalia, what you raised in the chat.

262
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.369
Doug Breitbart: It wasn't voiced in the video.

263
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.239
Doug Breitbart: So, I think you're okay.

264
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:52.050
Jerry Michalski: Oh, I… yeah, that's fine, and I… but I will… I will… I don't usually edit these. I will edit, Kalia's drop-in…

265
00:31:52.250 --> 00:32:01.640
Jerry Michalski: And now it's more… much more complicated because we're talking about it, so I'm gonna have to edit twice. But I will also clip what Kalia wrote in the chat.

266
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:02.770
Jerry Michalski: As well.

267
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.910
Jerry Michalski: Before I share the chat back up.

268
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:27.890
Jerry Michalski: Cool, then that didn't work so well, my apologies. And I should mention more often that these videos I do post directly… I'm a big believer in sort of open conversations, and these videos do go to YouTube, and that will have an effect on what we decide to talk about, and I'm…

269
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.250
Jerry Michalski: Quite aware of that.

270
00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:37.409
Jerry Michalski: So, my apologies for not repeating that more often, because we actually all should be quite aware of that.

271
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.170
Jerry Michalski: Tug.

272
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:49.110
Doug Breitbart: So, yeah, I… I, I was really… I was really intrigued by your intro to this session.

273
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:55.410
Doug Breitbart: And had… had an experience in the last 24 hours with a post.

274
00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:05.569
Doug Breitbart: that, sort of… The combination of the two, I think, is worth sharing.

275
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.789
Doug Breitbart: So there was… there was a post that…

276
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:18.420
Doug Breitbart: Did, like, a serious drill down on… Our current… Supreme Court.

277
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.050
Doug Breitbart: head.

278
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:24.660
Doug Breitbart: And his relationship and history with the Voting Rights Act.

279
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.359
Doug Breitbart: Which is long and deep and anti, with a capital A.

280
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:38.449
Doug Breitbart: And… I read this piece, which was… Very granded, very credible, and…

281
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.649
Doug Breitbart: Shed Him for me in a completely different light.

282
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:50.779
Doug Breitbart: Like, I've experienced his position as sort of an unknown quasi-neutral?

283
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:58.729
Doug Breitbart: in terms of the persona that I think he's publicly attempted to achieve for himself, Roberts.

284
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:12.609
Doug Breitbart: But what this post made clear was, no, he's a hardcore ideologue about certain things related to presidential power and related to, killing the Voting Rights Act.

285
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:22.190
Doug Breitbart: And… There was the theater and illusion, the public persona, and then there was the, oh.

286
00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.190
Doug Breitbart: Bat.

287
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:30.720
Doug Breitbart: And then connecting that to… So we know which way this whole redistricting thing is gonna come out.

288
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.780
Doug Breitbart: And it's not gonna be good.

289
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.840
Doug Breitbart: And,

290
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.559
Doug Breitbart: And my…

291
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:52.760
Doug Breitbart: orientation to receiving that recalibration. Like, it was exactly what you described in the intro to this session of receiving something that's just like, oh.

292
00:34:54.989 --> 00:35:01.039
Doug Breitbart: was… I can be reactive to that, or…

293
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.879
Doug Breitbart: I can just sort of recalibrate.

294
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.740
Doug Breitbart: My understanding of the world.

295
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:16.310
Doug Breitbart: Like, that's the way that piece of the existing puzzle… is, in fact… And,

296
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:21.690
Doug Breitbart: It gives me a better sense of The degree to which…

297
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:27.150
Doug Breitbart: Effectively, the court system has been zeroed out as well.

298
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:40.549
Doug Breitbart: Well, while the sort of wishful thinking underlying sense impression up to that moment was, maybe there's some salvation to be had out of the court system, but no, it's been done, like, taken care of.

299
00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:49.930
Doug Breitbart: going back to… going back to when this guy was a law clerk for Rehnquist. And, and it was sort of like…

300
00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:57.659
Doug Breitbart: There are all those knock-on recalibration, reconfiguration of

301
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.420
Doug Breitbart: The way of seeing what is.

302
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:11.579
Doug Breitbart: as sort of a ripple effect. It's sort of an update of the vision, of the map, of the picture.

303
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.539
Jerry Michalski: Can you describe that a little bit more?

304
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:25.760
Doug Breitbart: Yeah, so… you know, if I'm carrying this mosaic of, you know, the state of our government.

305
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.700
Doug Breitbart: And it's… it's…

306
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:42.429
Doug Breitbart: decimation. And I'm looking for pockets of integrity being held. I'm looking for pockets of structural, you know, persistence against the destruction and collapse.

307
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:48.819
Doug Breitbart: And I believe there are still some features of that landscape effective functioning and operating.

308
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:56.590
Doug Breitbart: And all of a sudden, like, the one sort of remaining pillar that…

309
00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.650
Doug Breitbart: That held some promise is neutral… is zeroed out.

310
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.170
Doug Breitbart: So, effectively, it's all gone.

311
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:09.650
Doug Breitbart: And how bad will they make it? How bad does it get?

312
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.399
Doug Breitbart: How much will that…

313
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.910
Doug Breitbart: manifest.

314
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.750
Doug Breitbart: You know, in consequences.

315
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:25.390
Doug Breitbart: And I'm, you know, picking up… data bits about…

316
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:33.520
Doug Breitbart: Failure sectors in the economy that are not public, you know, that haven't been, like, highlighted.

317
00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.770
Doug Breitbart: You know, the number of… farmer…

318
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.930
Doug Breitbart: Bankruptcy filings under, under, under 12.

319
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.149
Doug Breitbart: Is going through the roof.

320
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:55.499
Doug Breitbart: And, and they're not… they don't have the labor to harvest crops. So, like that, you know, how soon do the supermarket shelves start going there?

321
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:05.670
Doug Breitbart: you know, this is like now. This isn't some objective future, this is now. And, you know.

322
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.849
Doug Breitbart: Since the current course doesn't suggest

323
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:25.260
Doug Breitbart: actions within agencies are being governed by any sense of rule of law anymore. So, you know, when does Social Security checks stop?

324
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.630
Doug Breitbart: for me.

325
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:33.730
Doug Breitbart: Because of whatever category I fall into, or whatever office gets decimated through layoffs.

326
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:46.700
Doug Breitbart: So, it's, it's, it's very much, trying to… find clarity Personal clarity, sense of balance.

327
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.699
Doug Breitbart: what is real… you know, what is my reality?

328
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.850
Doug Breitbart: Now.

329
00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:00.270
Doug Breitbart: I don't… I really endeavor… To not react.

330
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.079
Doug Breitbart: But to figure out, you know, how to relate.

331
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.749
Doug Breitbart: It's not even rising to the level of how to respond, or how to act.

332
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:18.849
Doug Breitbart: or do, or contrib… or whatever, like, that's a whole secondary thing. It's like, How to… how to relate.

333
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:24.730
Doug Breitbart: To the scale and scope of changing reality.

334
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.390
Doug Breitbart: And find my ground first.

335
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:40.039
Doug Breitbart: before going to the, okay, so… is there a way I want to respond or directly engage in… in some kind of collaborative way, or…

336
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:49.730
Doug Breitbart: communication or, you know, engagement way, like going on Saturday to the local You know, no kings.

337
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.110
Doug Breitbart: demonstration.

338
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:57.180
Doug Breitbart: So, just slowing it down, and checking in.

339
00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.240
Doug Breitbart: So, I just, yeah, I'm complete.

340
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:06.959
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Doug. You've brought a bunch of things into my…

341
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.310
Jerry Michalski: brain that I want to share out.

342
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:30.509
Jerry Michalski: First, I'm among probably a large group of Americans who are pretty convinced that ICE tracking down immigrants, a lot of whom are agricultural farm workers, and the tariffs and all that kind of stuff would lead to, by now, by now, pretty miserable inflation and food shortages and other kinds of things.

343
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:43.409
Jerry Michalski: There are… there are some price bumps, but I don't… I don't think that… I don't think that dreadful future has materialized. The system has adapted, and this… the ball… the shoe may drop later, I don't know.

344
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:55.019
Jerry Michalski: But it didn't materialize the way the catastrophizers said immediately it was going to. And that happens all the time on all sides, right? So, that reminded me of the book Super Forecasting.

345
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.850
Jerry Michalski: by, Philip Tetlock.

346
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:18.109
Jerry Michalski: And he talks in the book about what makes a good forecast. And the problem is that most futurists and forecasters and all that make crappy forecasts where you really can't tell whether they were right or wrong. And that's the sign of a good weasel forecast, is you say something that gets you some news.

347
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:25.140
Jerry Michalski: And that can't be pinned down later on. It's like, oh, I was just off on the date, it happened but 5 years later. Like, yeah, that was a bad forecast.

348
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:38.029
Jerry Michalski: And so he has criteria with the Good Judgment Project. And he's found some people who are really, really good super forecasters. And I'm wondering, to what extent, and this would be a very nice sense-making, global brain-y kind of thing.

349
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.649
Jerry Michalski: To what extent can or should the

350
00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:49.289
Jerry Michalski: people writing about stuff try to do better on these fronts, and then judge themselves afterward. And I… I highly respect

351
00:41:49.290 --> 00:42:02.160
Jerry Michalski: bloggers and substackers and other sorts of people who occasionally say, hey, here's how I did on last year's predictions, or on last, you know, whatever it is. When they go back and grade themselves, even if sometimes they're a little lenient on themselves.

352
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.100
Jerry Michalski: That's interesting, because at least there's some kind of feedback loop

353
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:15.960
Jerry Michalski: of what's happening there, right? So, I'm very interested in the feedback and the social feedback, and also then I'll add.

354
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:41.190
Jerry Michalski: forecasting is really hard because some of these systems that we're talking about, like global warming, tipping points, and all that, are deeply nonlinear, and by the time you detect the third dot or the fourth dot, the fifth dot is way the hell north of where you thought it was going to be, and we're in serious, serious trouble. And how do you use the feedback I'm describing, and public discourse, and news, and other sorts of things that are

355
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:53.639
Jerry Michalski: heightened, that are improved in some way by doing some of what I just described, in a situation where when one of these things runs amok, it could run really amok. And the way Trump handles foreign policy

356
00:42:53.640 --> 00:43:06.929
Jerry Michalski: man, if Putin feels cornered and decides to throw nukes, that's gonna change the game considerably, right? And I don't know how these things play out, but I'm wondering how all that works. Gil, please.

357
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.890
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Total yes, Jerry.

358
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:15.050
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And, you know, again, it's the hazard of, of, of,

359
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:25.129
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, the lack of sensitivity and complexity, and for people to see nuance and see complex systems and understand that cause and effect is not all that it's cracked up to be.

360
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:39.049
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And how do you navigate in the midst of all that uncertainty? On the prediction thing, the great Ken Watt was trying to put together something decades ago to do a systematic retrospective analysis of predictions.

361
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:49.770
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which I don't know that anybody's ever done. You know, you look at market touts who are predicting the same thing for decades, and then all of a sudden they're right when that thing happens, you know, but they've been saying it every year, forever.

362
00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:55.249
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I've been describing myself lately as a futurist who's given up predicting the future.

363
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.550
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I think it's a fool's game at this point.

364
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.540
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Something else?

365
00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:13.220
Jerry Michalski: The Institute for the Future says we don't do predictions, we make forecasts, which are practical, plausible projections of something that might happen in the future, but we don't know and nobody can tell which one's gonna play out.

366
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:30.629
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, and, you know, and that's the power of scenario analysis, among other tools, exactly for that. People think it's predictive, but it's not. It's for… it's to sensitize us to possibility, and hopefully change the way that we think about stuff. There was something else I wanted to say, but it slipped, so off to someone else.

367
00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:35.070
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Oh, yeah, yes, the thing you said, Jerry, about,

368
00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:40.670
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We haven't seen the impact of the farm labor shortage yet. Don't get too confident.

369
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:47.520
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It's still the first season. There's still more harvests to come. It's,

370
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:53.389
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, I don't have detailed analysis on it, but the mood that I'm getting is that there's a mess looming.

371
00:44:55.670 --> 00:45:10.230
Jerry Michalski: I hear ya. Yeah. And I'd love to sort of say that that means this number by this date, or something. And I don't know that I challenge OGMers to always pin things down that way, but we might… we might want to have a session

372
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:16.960
Jerry Michalski: about what a good forecast looks like, and just train ourselves a bit. Go find a couple videos and have somebody volunteer to brief us

373
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.239
Jerry Michalski: On how to be more precise about forecasts.

374
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:33.590
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: For sure. Let me personalize a bit, coming off of what Doug said. On the Social Security thing, we've been looking at a bunch of financial and real estate decisions, and early this year, we decided that we couldn't make certain moves because Social Security might just get yanked.

375
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:42.380
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: which would completely change our spectrum of financial options. We've come to the conclusion now that it's probably not going to get yanked for folks like us.

376
00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:53.949
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, on… on… we've been on Social Security for 10 years, etc. For folks coming into the system, very much at risk. People not yet retired don't count on it at all.

377
00:45:54.060 --> 00:46:00.729
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: People may be a year or two in, may be at risk. I think for later folks, probably not. But, again, so there's a calculation.

378
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:06.710
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Based on very incomplete data and all sorts of stuff that we have no way to know anything about.

379
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.239
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And yet, we have to make decisions.

380
00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:15.500
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I mean, it's one of the more stressful things we've worked through, that we can remember.

381
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:20.850
Jerry Michalski: And decision-making under uncertainty is one of those monster themes, right?

382
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.379
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, please.

383
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:38.060
Stacey Druss: Yeah, speaking to your idea about prediction, as I was thinking about this yesterday, because as you know, I'm interested in engaging people in conversations, and I was just thinking it would be so nice if we could have a conversation that starts with

384
00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.849
Stacey Druss: If this is true, then we would expect to see this.

385
00:46:42.850 --> 00:47:00.909
Stacey Druss: If this is true, we would expect to see this. My particular area that I was focused on has to do with immigration, because I'm trying to convince the people in my community that this is a money grab and a for-profit detention, because I'm combating the local

386
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.890
Stacey Druss: Misinformation that's going on.

387
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:09.799
Stacey Druss: what I'm actually seeing… I mean, in one case, I'm very happy. After somebody was…

388
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:27.269
Stacey Druss: detained for over 2 months, they were finally released. I'm grateful they were released. I don't want to throw attention on the judges that are eventually releasing the people, but at the same time, I have a feeling we're gonna look back

389
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:35.339
Stacey Druss: And we're gonna see all this money that was spent detaining people to finally release them back to their families.

390
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:39.810
Stacey Druss: So, to me, It would be productive to say.

391
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:48.260
Stacey Druss: Okay, let's look at that. That's one scenario. Let's see how many people, after they finally show up in court.

392
00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.739
Stacey Druss: We wind up sending back.

393
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:57.900
Stacey Druss: At least if we could have a conversation and maybe have that taped.

394
00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:22.579
Stacey Druss: have that drive the spotlight to look on individual cases, and what's going on locally, where on a local level, we really see firsthand who's getting targeted, and why they're getting targeted, and all those things. It could bring the people in the middle together. You know, Gil put in the chat that the speaker had said that

395
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:37.970
Stacey Druss: one way of looking at the difference between the left and the right is that the right look, you know, the right are, like, looking at themselves as protectors, and the left is liberators. And to a certain degree, I think that's true, and for me, I always look at the intersection.

396
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:57.890
Stacey Druss: You know, where are those people right in the middle? Because depending on who I'm talking to, I try to get them to see the other piece that they're missing. So, like, if I'm talking to that protector person, I'm going to recognize that and showing how this action is a protecting one, and vice versa.

397
00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:05.189
Stacey Druss: But, again, we're always behind the eight ball of predicting. Like, why can't we jump ahead

398
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:15.540
Stacey Druss: and get together, all of us, and say, okay, everybody, let's brainstorm. We're not saying who's right or wrong. If this is the case.

399
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:22.620
Stacey Druss: This is what we're gonna see. If this is the case, this is what we're gonna see. Let's just agree on…

400
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:29.820
Stacey Druss: What would happen if Instead of digging down on, this is what's happening.

401
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:31.630
Stacey Druss: Over.

402
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.139
Jerry Michalski: So, thanks, Stacey. So, making these

403
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:42.380
Jerry Michalski: forecasts, and I'll use the word very loosely, more provisional or conditional on some facts on the ground, or things like that.

404
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.210
Jerry Michalski: I think that makes sense.

405
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.770
Stacey Druss: Seeing on what the measurement would…

406
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:59.190
Stacey Druss: Like, let's just agree on that, because also, it will help people come in at a beginner's level and generate some ideas. Like, let's just start at the beginner's level.

407
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:00.690
Jerry Michalski: Yeah.

408
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:06.380
Jerry Michalski: You've also reminded me that the same administration that is doing those kinds of things

409
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:15.880
Jerry Michalski: has unmarked cars on the street with, ICE people who have no badges visible and have masks on, who are abducting people.

410
00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:23.069
Jerry Michalski: And, I grew up partly in Argentina. I'm old enough that we left Argentina just before the dirty war started.

411
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:32.219
Jerry Michalski: And I went back in… 89, I guess, at some point? I think… no, sorry, 80… in 85.

412
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:48.090
Jerry Michalski: I had a project, actually, that took me to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and as a goodbye gift, they gave me the book Nunca Mas, which means Never Again, which is a book compiled out of all of the testimonies from the Truth and Reconciliation Commissions that happened in Argentina after the dirty War.

413
00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:55.359
Jerry Michalski: And one of the interesting factors in Argentina was, during the dirty War, the Ford Falcon.

414
00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:10.950
Jerry Michalski: A dark green Ford Falcon was a very scary car to see in the street, because that's what the military police and others used to abduct people. So if a Ford Falcon pulled up in front of your house, they were probably gonna, like, search you and maybe take you away, and maybe you wouldn't be seen again.

415
00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.120
Jerry Michalski: And, and so, for me, the, the idea that, that.

416
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:33.750
Jerry Michalski: people on American streets, and I won't say American citizens, because maybe they're not, I don't know, but people walking down American streets or being abducted with no identification, and we don't know where they go is deeply, deeply frightening, because it leads, for me, straight to things that I think are horrible historically.

417
00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:42.660
Jerry Michalski: And I don't know which parts of that little narrative to complexify and to say, oh, but, and this there, and I don't know. I don't know.

418
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:59.460
Jerry Michalski: It's, it's… these are… we live in troubling, scary times, and I'm… part of this conversation is to say, how do we handle these conversations in a way that lets us be… remain a bit pliable or permeable.

419
00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:03.240
Jerry Michalski: So that we can find more understanding, and so forth.

420
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:04.819
Jerry Michalski: Gil, go ahead.

421
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:14.179
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And, You know, put the masked… the masked armed thugs in unmarked vehicles together with stand-your-ground laws.

422
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:16.620
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And then what happens?

423
00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.319
Jerry Michalski: Well, also, the… the Black Panther Party

424
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:27.440
Jerry Michalski: originally was the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, I believe.

425
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:43.059
Jerry Michalski: And they, found a law that said you can stand, you can be armed and stand as long as you're X number of yards or feet away from police, you can stand there armed and watch them. And, you know, it's legal.

426
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.880
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But we're in a time when legal doesn't matter.

427
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.739
Jerry Michalski: I totally agree.

428
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:53.070
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And they're, you know, and they're arresting people who are standing there videoing them from across the street.

429
00:52:53.070 --> 00:53:01.890
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, they're operating in extra-legal ways, and one of my fears is that the court system, the entire legal system, is now disabled.

430
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.449
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, hang on.

431
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:05.939
Jerry Michalski: Yeah. Good.

432
00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:20.870
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: One of the other talks at Sustainable Brands was from Andrew Winston, saying that… I'm gonna go a little sideways for a moment here, saying that he keeps… he's a major speaker to sustainable business, and he's always asked, he says, is sustainability dead?

433
00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:24.330
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And he said, no, it's not dead, it's under attack.

434
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.410
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which is different.

435
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:35.099
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, and things aren't under attack unless there's reason for them to be attacked. So, same thing here. The court system is not over, it's very much under threat.

436
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:42.029
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Most of the decisions, there's, like, hundreds of lawsuits against these guys, and most of them they have lost.

437
00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.220
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: What's up for question is where the Supremes are gonna go.

438
00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:53.720
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Because we're at the mercy here of a 40-year project by Rehnquist and Alito to do what they're doing.

439
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.849
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It was just laid out back during the Nixon administration.

440
00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:12.799
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Or whenever Reagan, I guess, is what they were under. They were not… they're not quite old enough for that. you know, so we don't know. That… that… I mean, you know, there's voting rights decisions that could come this week or next week that could change, you know, that could lock the elections down.

441
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:20.349
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: for a long time to come, if we have elections. So, I don't mean to make light of it, but the courts are an important battleground.

442
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:31.400
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Notable yesterday, I don't know if people saw this on the news, but pretty much unified the national news organizations refused to sign Pete Hegseth's loyalty oath.

443
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:41.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And maybe people are starting to realize that, that instead of letting, Trump pick you off one by one, as surprisingly the major law firms did.

444
00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:44.639
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And a lot of the universities did.

445
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.970
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: People can actually forge common purpose and fight back.

446
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.570
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And what does that mean in terms of bad Supreme Court decisions? I don't know.

447
00:54:54.010 --> 00:55:00.040
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But I'm not, you know, gay man over till a fat lady's sung, or whatever the expression is, and…

448
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.470
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: She ain't sung yet.

449
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.290
Jerry Michalski: Surprised that saying had some, you know, such long legs.

450
00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.400
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Over time.

451
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.339
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, well, the Pat lady had short legs, but that's a different thing.

452
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.450
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, who knows?

453
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:16.209
Jerry Michalski: Anyone else? Thoughts on this topic?

454
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.790
Jerry Michalski: concerns… Disagreements.

455
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.250
Jerry Michalski: Wishes.

456
00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.449
Jerry Michalski: Should research topics.

457
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:41.950
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No, it's obviously time to be quiet for a while.

458
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.409
Jerry Michalski: We could be quiet for a little while, see what shows up.

459
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.589
Mike Nelson: Well, this is Mike not being quiet.

460
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:55.590
Mike Nelson: I do think one of the strategies you outlined at the very start is…

461
00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:02.350
Mike Nelson: Being quiet long enough to understand that you may have been wrong about something you assumed to be right.

462
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:03.890
Mike Nelson: And,

463
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:12.130
Mike Nelson: Unfortunately, we're not given time to do that anymore. I mean, I don't think we've been given time to do that for 30 or 40 years.

464
00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:19.229
Mike Nelson: We used to have… I still go to church, and there's some meditation time there, but…

465
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:33.150
Mike Nelson: even that is typically 30 seconds, you know? I mean, if we have a really meaningful sermon, maybe there'll be 2 minutes where people just kind of calm and, you know, what do I want to take home from this?

466
00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.260
Mike Nelson: But I, I do think we'd, we…

467
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:41.179
Mike Nelson: We're so overstressed, we're so sleep-deprived.

468
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.110
Mike Nelson: That we… we don't know how to handle the,

469
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:51.409
Mike Nelson: Confused inputs that are coming from all these different directions and contradicting themselves.

470
00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.009
Mike Nelson: One of my favorite hashtags lately has been discombobulation.

471
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:57.689
Mike Nelson: I know.

472
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.320
Mike Nelson: disinformation… Leads to deception.

473
00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:06.950
Mike Nelson: Leads to discord. Leads to discombobulation.

474
00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:11.759
Mike Nelson: leads to… Despair and or apathy.

475
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.369
Mike Nelson: And that's a short step to dictatorship.

476
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:21.149
Mike Nelson: Because if enough people just sit on the sidelines and throw up their hands and say, I don't know what's going on.

477
00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.019
Mike Nelson: That's where we end up.

478
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:39.650
Jerry Michalski: two… two reactions to what you just said, Mike. One positive, one negative. The negative one is, one of the current tactics of the current, at least, far right, is to flood the zone with shit.

479
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.660
Jerry Michalski: That is a very explicit tactic, that if you have people too busy

480
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:57.400
Jerry Michalski: to deal with, they'll just drop everything. And also, too confused about which side to be on, because, oh, wait a minute, the baddie is funding the good guys that I'm listening to, maybe I should stop listening to the good guys?

481
00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:05.629
Jerry Michalski: And, there's a documentary I love called Hypernormalization by Adam Curtis, where he talks about Putin and his Lieutenant Surkov.

482
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:12.890
Jerry Michalski: who were doing this for years, years ago. They were sort of busy honing this, perfecting this art of flooding the zone with shit.

483
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.850
Jerry Michalski: And that's happening.

484
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:31.669
Jerry Michalski: But on the other hand, maybe this is the positive side, I don't know. This is also about attention management. And Ken Homer just sent us a love… wrote us a lovely poem, you know, that he just read to us, about stepping out of the torrent and the conversations and things like that.

485
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:38.459
Jerry Michalski: it's not that we aren't given the time, it's that we don't make the time. I think that it's…

486
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:51.710
Jerry Michalski: possible, and when there's too much information, I don't mean you can subtly, magically make the time to know all of that and to sort it out. I think what you do is you step out of it and have focus on something else.

487
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:53.730
Jerry Michalski: But…

488
00:58:54.360 --> 00:59:04.000
Jerry Michalski: There's a growing little niche in the world about how do you cope with change, and how do you maintain equanimity in the face of

489
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:10.440
Jerry Michalski: Actual turbulence, and political turbulence, and emotional turbulence, and other kinds of things that are happening.

490
00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:15.149
Jerry Michalski: And that's probably a good topic for an OGM call at some point, as well.

491
00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.080
Jerry Michalski: Gil, please.

492
00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.939
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, it is… it is a good topic.

493
00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:28.050
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: One of the things we've done in our house is dramatically cut down on our news diet.

494
00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:38.690
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, I suggest that as a possibility. On the matter of time and quiet, and Mike, thanks for what you said.

495
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:43.550
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't know if people have watched Charlie Kirk's… competitive debate.

496
00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.360
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Forum.

497
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:54.949
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I've seen Mehdi Hassan do this on the left, and Charlie Kirk do this on the right, where they sit at a table. It's like… like a… like a chess match table, small table.

498
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: People facing off, and they're surrounded by a circle of about 20 or 30 people.

499
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:09.629
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And anybody in the circle gets to come in and sit down opposing them and have a conversation with them. And it's like, it's like, what's the term for speed chess? You know, where you have the clock and you're moving really fast?

500
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:14.800
Jerry Michalski: It's, it's a, it's a high-speed competitive debate format.

501
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:24.579
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And it's interesting because it's, you know, it's showing off a kind of cognitive and communication skill, but it allows for no thought.

502
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:37.579
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Allows for no reflection. Allows for no consideration. Highly polarizing. And, it's really, really weird to watch. I've seen both these guys do it, and I hate both of them doing it.

503
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.760
Jerry Michalski: I watched one with Mehdi doing it, and I was really turned off. He was… everybody was interrupting everybody.

504
01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:52.269
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, and he's like, you know, he's right in everybody's… I mean, there are things that I agree with him on, and found him hate… found myself hating him.

505
01:00:53.700 --> 01:01:02.999
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And it's… and in all of these things, back to what we were saying before, it's taking potentially complex or complicated issues and saying, no, it's not complicated.

506
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:19.669
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: One of the reasons I stepped out of Facebook, which I did, like, a month ago now, is that I was in conversations where people were kind of, you know, not even people I knew, people who knew people I knew were jumping into conversations I was having and yelling at me, saying, it's not complicated. What's the matter with you?

507
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.200
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I think, my God, it really is, so…

508
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.399
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So I decided to step back. It's another kind of quiet, less social media.

509
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:29.649
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We're very selective social media.

510
01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:38.199
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which, reminder, we all know this here, but it's worth remind… remembering that in that machinery, we are the product.

511
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.140
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We think it's something that we're using. We're the product.

512
01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.130
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Anytime the service is free.

513
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:48.500
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, the product.

514
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:52.410
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, I'll stop here.

515
01:01:52.660 --> 01:02:10.570
Jerry Michalski: Well, I'm not sure any… I'm not sure that with the conclusion, anytime the service is free, we are the product, because in commons, and in a different world, on a parallel plane in the multiverse, lots of things can be free, and it's not because we are the product being sold off, it's because…

516
01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.700
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I heard that as I was saying it, Sherry.

517
01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:18.579
Jerry Michalski: we're actually sharing resources in an abundant way, yada yada yada, probably another good topic for an OGM call.

518
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.620
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Kevin and his Mennonite… Mennonite carpenters, not… not.

519
01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.130
Jerry Michalski: I like that.

520
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:23.930
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I totally, totally get it.

521
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:26.599
Jerry Michalski: Like that, exactly. So, thank you for that.

522
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.010
Jerry Michalski: Scott, please.

523
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.679
Jerry Michalski: Scott, you need to unmute.

524
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.050
Jerry Michalski: Scott, you need to come back to the keyboard. There you are, good.

525
01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.249
Jerry Michalski: Yes, we're hearing you now.

526
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:50.270
Scott Moehring: I'm actually on the road, so I will, but…

527
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.210
Scott Moehring: So you can all hear me?

528
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.029
Jerry Michalski: Yes, you sound like you're in a car, but we can hear you just fine.

529
01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.290
Scott Moehring: I am in a car, but I will try to make it less… less car-shot.

530
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.910
Scott Moehring: I am enjoying this particular call in its entirety more than I have in a while.

531
01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.250
Scott Moehring: I am seeing or hearing a humbleness.

532
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.910
Scott Moehring: uncertainty.

533
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:18.540
Scott Moehring: that I… or uncertainty, rather. I'm not exactly sure how to say that.

534
01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:23.999
Scott Moehring: I'm appreciating everyone saying, you know, this is something that I wasn't expecting.

535
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:27.770
Scott Moehring: And it's making me think about something differently.

536
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.479
Scott Moehring: And I'm actually open to that.

537
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:37.500
Scott Moehring: And I think that that is, if there is a route, That's…

538
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:42.080
Scott Moehring: you know, our current crises, I think that that's Definitely one of them.

539
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:49.600
Scott Moehring: Is that we are… I don't know if anybody saw, I wrote in the Plex this.

540
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.170
Scott Moehring: Most recent issue about Comple- compression.

541
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:55.680
Jerry Michalski: Yep.

542
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.750
Scott Moehring: And sometimes I have a phrase that comes out, and I don't actually

543
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:04.330
Scott Moehring: Will it to come out? It just comes out, and then I see it, and I think, huh.

544
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:06.129
Scott Moehring: That's actually kind of neat.

545
01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.039
Scott Moehring: And it was… Consuming more of less.

546
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:20.449
Scott Moehring: And I thought that was interesting, because the way I thought of that, after I read it, after the words came out, I thought.

547
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:24.869
Scott Moehring: Yeah, that's really what it is. It's just… This idea of…

548
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:30.540
Scott Moehring: I already know what that is, so I don't need to consume any more of it.

549
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:35.850
Scott Moehring: And I go, look for the next thing, and the next thing, without actually really getting into the thing that…

550
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.540
Scott Moehring: I've already summed up in some way, but…

551
01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:49.589
Scott Moehring: Sorry, my thoughts are a little all over the place. I appreciated Stacy's comments about making predictions, and then making second predictions.

552
01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:55.480
Scott Moehring: and just… putting some stake in there, instead of saying, I know exactly what's gonna happen.

553
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.360
Scott Moehring: And… We're probably wrong.

554
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:05.140
Scott Moehring: at least in some way, we're probably wrong. I appreciated your comment, Jerry, about,

555
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:13.440
Scott Moehring: You know, futurists, and trying to make predictions and guesses, and then actually being Held accountable to

556
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.219
Scott Moehring: To at least the prediction.

557
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:22.559
Scott Moehring: You know, I think that that's all really important, and it's a humbleness. I think that's my only teaching.

558
01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.700
Scott Moehring: It's the willingness to say, you know.

559
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.069
Scott Moehring: I bet I don't see everything. I bet I don't know everything.

560
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:36.229
Scott Moehring: And if something shows up, am I willing to incorporate that into my own mental model, allow it to be changed?

561
01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:44.780
Jerry Michalski: Thank you very much. Totally, really appreciate your reflections on

562
01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:46.999
Jerry Michalski: On the nature of this column.

563
01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:50.980
Jerry Michalski: you're calling things out I hadn't really noticed about the call, which I love.

564
01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.400
Jerry Michalski: So, that's great.

565
01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.510
Jerry Michalski: Anyone else? Thoughts?

566
01:05:58.450 --> 01:05:59.440
Jerry Michalski: Actually…

567
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:06.009
Jerry Michalski: Let's go into that little moment of silence that Gil mentioned a moment ago. I will bring us back out in a moment to

568
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.209
Jerry Michalski: Thank you very much.

569
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.330
Jerry Michalski: Reflections? Jokes?

570
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.510
Jerry Michalski: Other things?

571
01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.840
Scott Moehring: I did have one other thing, actually, that I forgot to mention. Sorry, Jerry.

572
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.699
Jerry Michalski: Go ahead, and then Stacey.

573
01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:31.379
Scott Moehring: when I was reading your email about

574
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.700
Scott Moehring: precipitated this. Here's the theme of the call.

575
01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:38.490
Scott Moehring: I was thinking… of that.

576
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:44.640
Scott Moehring: a quote that I will misquote slightly, Which is… it's amazing…

577
01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:49.040
Scott Moehring: What you can get done, if nobody cares who gets the credit.

578
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:53.879
Scott Moehring: So, I'm just throwing that out there, I don't know if you want to

579
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:59.839
Scott Moehring: Riff on that a little bit, but if that's what it seemed like, was happening,

580
01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:07.860
Scott Moehring: This is, you know, ceasefire, awesome! Right? Like, that's kind of what we want, but…

581
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.249
Scott Moehring: There's the issue of credit.

582
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:15.239
Scott Moehring: And… and that is part of it, at the… So, that's all for me.

583
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:22.380
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. The quote I have is from Harry Truman. It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.

584
01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:39.029
Jerry Michalski: And it's very likely one of those things that's been said by… actually, there's a Quote Investigator article about this that has a whole bunch of other people saying it, and their phrase is, a man may do an immense deal of good if he does not care who gets the credit, and I'll post both of those in the chat.

585
01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:41.920
Stacey Druss: I thought Craig Bonnegan said that.

586
01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.560
Jerry Michalski: See? Seeing?

587
01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:54.220
Mike Nelson: It was Al Gore's favorite quotation when he was vice president, partly because it was said by a previous vice president when he was vice president and invisible.

588
01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:59.269
Mike Nelson: And every time Gore tried to stand up and take credit for something.

589
01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:07.050
Mike Nelson: Boom! They just… they worked so hard to make sure He, was misrepresented, misquoted.

590
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:18.440
Mike Nelson: At one point, he got excited about a project, a very cheap satellite that was going to orbit in the L1 point between the Earth and the Sun, and provide 24-hour-a-day coverage

591
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:24.429
Mike Nelson: of the sunny side of the Earth. I mean, literally less than $200 million.

592
01:09:24.649 --> 01:09:35.199
Mike Nelson: And, as a NASA project goes, that's pretty darn cheap. And the Senate Republicans held it up for 5 years, just because Gore thought it was a good idea.

593
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:40.379
Mike Nelson: The entire community thought it was a great idea, incredibly cost-effective, but…

594
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:45.550
Mike Nelson: They held it up. They didn't want him getting any credit for anything. They knew he was gonna run for…

595
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.960
Mike Nelson: For president, and they didn't want him to have any accomplishments.

596
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:56.819
Jerry Michalski: Which is a marvel to me because Gore is Obama's Oh, sorry.

597
01:09:58.299 --> 01:09:59.729
Jerry Michalski: I've got the, the…

598
01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:00.550
Mike Nelson: Clinton's vice president.

599
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:09.219
Jerry Michalski: Clinton's vice president, that's right. Because later, later, Obama… I'm pretty certain the right doesn't want Obama to succeed on anything.

600
01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:16.669
Jerry Michalski: And he does. He manages to have the economy just go chug-chug-chug-chug-chug, and he manages to pass some degree of

601
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:33.670
Jerry Michalski: of health coverage and so forth that they've not been able to extinguish. I track in my brain the many times that the right has tried to get rid of Obamacare, and it's an astonishing… really, there have been astonishing battles fought to try to, you know, get rid of it. They've managed to weaken it, but not get rid of it entirely.

602
01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:43.160
Jerry Michalski: At this point, at this point, the thing we haven't mentioned for 3 calls, or whatever, is the lockdown in, the government showdown over the budget.

603
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.039
Jerry Michalski: And, the shut… the government shut down.

604
01:10:46.040 --> 01:11:04.240
Jerry Michalski: And one of the big issues is the continuation of the subsidies that allow Obamacare to be affordable. That is one of the monster issues on the table that the Democrats have decided is a hill to die on for this particular issue. And it feels to me like the Democrats have the sort of moral upper hand on this one, although

605
01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.739
Jerry Michalski: Public opinion and moral upper hand don't always agree.

606
01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:11.599
Mike Nelson: Fortunately, there's alliteration against them.

607
01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.700
Mike Nelson: Schumer's shutdown.

608
01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.830
Jerry Michalski: Schumer shut down out. There you go.

609
01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.699
Mike Nelson: But yeah, 40 times, I think, they had votes or tried to…

610
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.379
Mike Nelson: put a poison pill into the, Obamacare program.

611
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.060
Jerry Michalski: Yeah. Yeah, it's astonishing.

612
01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:46.299
Jerry Michalski: And I gotta say, Trump too, which is how I refer to the second Trump administration, is payback for milquetoast efforts within the bounds of the system to try to fight back on things that the right didn't like.

613
01:11:46.920 --> 01:12:02.209
Jerry Michalski: And I'm sitting here thinking SCOTUS, the Supreme Court of the United States, is very Republican because they stole seats because the left didn't act up and say, hey, wait a minute, you can't do that. We're gonna do something dramatic.

614
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:10.680
Jerry Michalski: to make sure that we get to vote on those seats. Like, two seats on Supreme Court were basically stolen, as far as I can tell.

615
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.260
Mike Nelson: Yep.

616
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:22.810
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm… I don't understand, Jay, that you say that's… that that's Trumpist reaction to what the Dems did. What we're seeing is the playing out of a 50-year explicitly written-about strategy.

617
01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:24.490
Jerry Michalski: Also, yes.

618
01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:35.070
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, let's, you know, I think it's mythification to say, oh, they're angry at the Democrats who did or didn't do whatever. This has been… you know, they've been rolling out this game plan since 1973.

619
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.950
Jerry Michalski: Since the Powell memo in 70, I think.

620
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.840
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I have the date wrong then, so I'm talking… Yeah, yeah.

621
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.430
Jerry Michalski: All memos.

622
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:47.910
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Referencing the Powell memo. And if people haven't seen it, there's a movie called Heist, The Stealing of the American Dream.

623
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:52.920
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That unfolds that story. It's a terrific piece of work. I'll find the link and post it for y'all.

624
01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.450
Doug Breitbart: I'm not sure it doesn't trace back to the Civil War, Gil.

625
01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:08.460
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, there's that, too, and you can take it back, you know, another 100 years before that. But in terms of an explicit, published strategy…

626
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.349
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And in the spirit of, you know, Maya Angelou, when people tell you who they are, believe them.

627
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:21.999
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You've got that there, you've got Bannon's writings, you've got Dugan's writings in the Russian sphere. None of this is mysterious.

628
01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:24.770
Jerry Michalski: Huh?

629
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:28.809
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Unless you get your information from the mass media, in which case it's mysterious.

630
01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:38.230
Jerry Michalski: So I agree with your framing of this is a much longer battle than I was just saying. Partly, I think what I'm… what I was trying to say is…

631
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:56.470
Jerry Michalski: the right's attempts to stay within the lines of the legal system, et cetera, et cetera, did not work. They tried to bring things to the floor. The reason, I think, that most of what Trump does is by executive order and fiat and just acting outside of the bounds of what we think is…

632
01:13:56.470 --> 01:14:09.050
Jerry Michalski: what is likely even legal to do, is that bringing things to the floor of Congress did not work for a long time. Trump won. Trump won, and a bunch of other efforts to tip over, you know, all these things.

633
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:10.710
Jerry Michalski: We're flailing.

634
01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:25.349
Jerry Michalski: flailing. And the left is grateful that a bunch of adults in the room threw their bodies in front of the more radical things that Trump 1 wanted to do. And in between Trump 1 and Trump 2, everybody on the far right said, well, great, that didn't work.

635
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:40.410
Jerry Michalski: we're going to take a much more, much more dramatic approach, which is a fulfillment of things set in motion back in 1970, et cetera, et cetera, which was a reaction to Barry Goldwater losing the election in 64.

636
01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:48.170
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which threw the Conservative Party into a dramatic crisis, into a huge identity crisis, out of which come these, I think.

637
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:53.299
Jerry Michalski: Long-term thinking brilliant strategies, and I don't see long-term thinkers on the left.

638
01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:59.329
Jerry Michalski: And sorry, this has become a bit of a political conversation toward the end of our time together, but…

639
01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:06.050
Jerry Michalski: Thoughts on this, other, other, other ways of seeing this, welcome. Please.

640
01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.769
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Throw them onto the table.

641
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.230
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't think Powell contemplated Trump.

642
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:19.529
Jerry Michalski: I don't think Newt Gingrich contemplated a Trump. Like, Newt Ginger.

643
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:23.969
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I think Powell was enough of an old, you know, small L liberal.

644
01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:24.540
Jerry Michalski: Yeah.

645
01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:31.540
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: To not be looking for a coup. He was looking for, you know, playing out within the game. Gingrich…

646
01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:40.810
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: in Jane's interpretation, gets a lot of credit for the mess, because when he became Speaker, he changed the schedule.

647
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.780
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: of the House of Representatives.

648
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.049
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And basically…

649
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:45.310
Jerry Michalski: many things.

650
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:52.170
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, but this one is a pivotal one, because he shortened the work week so that members could go home on the weekends.

651
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.989
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Quote, to be with their constituents.

652
01:15:55.230 --> 01:16:04.539
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But the result of that is that the social relationships between Republican-Democrat members and their families, and their wives who had been friends, broke.

653
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.569
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And maybe was one of the pivotal

654
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:13.049
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: One of the pivotal elements in the increasing polarization in the House.

655
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:20.650
Jerry Michalski: So, in my brain, I've got a thought. Gringrich created the current political rift in America. Under that, ways Gingrich transformed Congress.

656
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:26.619
Jerry Michalski: Do not cooperate, do not compromise, do not seek bipartisan solutions ever on anything.

657
01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:28.960
Jerry Michalski: They got rid of,

658
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:39.810
Jerry Michalski: basically, he stopped people from… he instituted message discipline, he wouldn't let Republicans room with Democrats. They used to share crash pads in DC.

659
01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:52.499
Jerry Michalski: They would rent a house with four bedrooms, and then Republicans and Democrats would room together and dine together and all that. He made that basically illegal. He said, he said, you do that, we're not going to fund you for the primary.

660
01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:56.569
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And, and, you know, having a throttle.

661
01:16:56.570 --> 01:17:02.369
Jerry Michalski: On the primaries was, a huge, power Power move that really worked.

662
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.799
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Could you share the link to that piece of the brain chair?

663
01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:11.470
Jerry Michalski: I just… I just put a link in the chat to Ways Dinguish Transformed Congress. I did that before I said… started screen sharing.

664
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:20.079
Shawn Murphy: There was a wonderful article in, what was it, Harper's years ago about, I think it was called The Family? Was that the name of it?

665
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:21.930
Jerry Michalski: Sounds familiar?

666
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:29.090
Shawn Murphy: Staggering. Staggering. Basically, it was a, it…

667
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:37.220
Shawn Murphy: it was a club, slash… it was, in effect, a condo.

668
01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:55.349
Shawn Murphy: a co-housing sort of situation where a whole bunch of Republican, legislators were living together in a plex. Like, it was like a polycule. It was absolutely incredible. And this thing had been set up in the, in,

669
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:56.509
Jerry Michalski: It's the fellowship.

670
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:58.720
Shawn Murphy: The… is it the fellowship?

671
01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:05.110
Jerry Michalski: I… I… is this… Christian fundamentalist thing? So there's a mini-series called The Family.

672
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:14.989
Jerry Michalski: Which was on Netflix, which was about the fellowship, and there's also a book called The Family, The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power. I think you mean…

673
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:21.469
Shawn Murphy: Yeah, yeah. I think it was founded in about 57 or something is when the visionary, had the vision.

674
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:24.180
Shawn Murphy: 1935.

675
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.260
Jerry Michalski: 35, the fellowship. Hold on, let me do a screen share again.

676
01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.869
Shawn Murphy: Anyway, because I've got all this stuff.

677
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:29.330
Jerry Michalski: to my branch.

678
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:36.239
Jerry Michalski: So here, so the… here's the fellowship, a Secret Society of Christian Fundamentalists,

679
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:49.879
Jerry Michalski: founded by a lot of conservatives who hated the New Deal, because this is against the New Deal. Abraham Vareideg, Douglas Co, names I don't remember even putting in my brain. But then in 2019, there was a mini-series about it.

680
01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:57.039
Jerry Michalski: Called The Family. I'm just gonna connect these things to my brain. I mean, to the… these are my notes from today's call.

681
01:18:58.410 --> 01:19:02.589
Jerry Michalski: And so the fellowship is basically the start of that.

682
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:05.180
Shawn Murphy: K.

683
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:09.429
Shawn Murphy: Anyway, everybody should know about this. It's… it is…

684
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:16.670
Shawn Murphy: It's really the essence, perhaps, of how the machine works on the right.

685
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:22.210
Mike Nelson: And their main facility is a mile from where I live, and I often jog past it.

686
01:19:22.210 --> 01:19:22.830
Jerry Michalski: Wow.

687
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:24.740
Mike Nelson: It's hidden away in the woods.

688
01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:26.649
Mike Nelson: In Arlington, Virginia.

689
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:36.699
Mike Nelson: And it's mostly occupied by 20-somethings, conservative Christian men and women who may become their wives.

690
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:44.570
Mike Nelson: And they all commute to the Hill, where they work for various conservative Huh?

691
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:50.660
Jerry Michalski: Of course, of course the left has an equivalent, you know, instrument just like this. It's called the Zen Center of San Francisco.

692
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:56.960
Shawn Murphy: Huh. Thank you.

693
01:19:57.430 --> 01:20:03.949
Jerry Michalski: Anyway, well, we've gone down this rabbit hole pretty deep. Any other thoughts along this line?

694
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:17.729
Jerry Michalski: I think, Gil, when you were saying this is a long, thought-out strategy, it's been playing out for a long time, I completely agree, and I fear that there are many more terrific strategists on the right than on the left.

695
01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:28.969
Jerry Michalski: On the left are a bunch of well-intentioned people who think policy is how to do things and want to build big institutions to solve social problems, which I think is a problematic approach to social problems.

696
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:29.430
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Okay.

697
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.820
Jerry Michalski: I actually do.

698
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.780
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And who trusts reason and fairness more than power.

699
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:41.039
Jerry Michalski: Yes, and on the right are a bunch of people who understand power and working together more than all those other things.

700
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.350
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: The other thing the right has had, though, which is… Wow.

701
01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:47.889
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Maybe just had a little quick.

702
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:51.399
Jerry Michalski: Oh, I thought, I thought ice was at your door.

703
01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:59.489
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Or something. is, large, consistent, stable funding.

704
01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:00.850
Jerry Michalski: Yes.

705
01:21:00.850 --> 01:21:05.220
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That built institutions, and built farm teams, and trained people, but…

706
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:15.200
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I mean, I'm on the board of a fiscal sponsor, so I deal with a bunch of not-for-profits and foundations and so forth, and the amount of grief…

707
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.650
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That folks have to go through to get funding.

708
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.620
Jerry Michalski: Hmm.

709
01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:26.480
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: The micromanagement that the foundations have over the folks they fund. The amount of time that's spent in reporting rather than doing the work.

710
01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:38.000
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: is horrific, and it's an echo in a lot of layers of American society, because you look at the growth of the administrative layer in everything from universities to healthcare to everywhere else.

711
01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:50.169
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There's that mess, but, you know, with Scafey and Mellon and various others on the right, there's been very consistent funding, and I guess the other part of this, which is maybe problematic to the left, is that for the right, it's a very good investment.

712
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:57.809
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Buying congresspeople is an incredibly good investment. The ROI's terrific.

713
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:06.780
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And that's not the language of the left, that's the language of the right, and they've been playing that for a long time, very effectively.

714
01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:12.090
Jerry Michalski: Totally agree.

715
01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:15.690
Jerry Michalski: There's my tracking of conservative foundations.

716
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:17.130
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yep, and the fellowship.

717
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:20.019
Jerry Michalski: Coke… the Koch Foundation's SCAFE… is it Scafey?

718
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:21.960
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I think, I think so, I don't know.

719
01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.920
Jerry Michalski: Koch family, heritage,

720
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:37.489
Jerry Michalski: Bradley, Lynn and Harry Bradley Foundation, Smith Richardson Foundation, these are all deeply conservative foundations that have funded the movement we just talked about, so you're right.

721
01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:45.039
Jerry Michalski: the left I'm busy listening very carefully for any progressive who's saying something different.

722
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:49.580
Jerry Michalski: sensible, and I'm not hearing any. I'm hearing a couple who

723
01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:58.400
Jerry Michalski: have struck authenticity, they're figuring out how to connect with people, that's great, but their messages don't sound any different from a traditional,

724
01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.850
Jerry Michalski: progressive.

725
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:01.299
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I'm… I'm…

726
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:05.050
Jerry Michalski: Really concerned that this is a battle of…

727
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:13.859
Jerry Michalski: Ideologies where the left doesn't have a grip on any layer of how to do this better or right.

728
01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:18.739
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, Jerry, how could that be different?

729
01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:23.529
Jerry Michalski: Alright, that's a… that's… so I'm… I'm really interested in how…

730
01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:24.230
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: topic.

731
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:32.439
Jerry Michalski: I'm really interested in how to build a better world, and some of the calls we've had, I mean, we had a little series on what works in governance.

732
01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:45.719
Jerry Michalski: We had, I think I did 4 calls on little g governance instead of big G government, and my goal was to try to collect up a stack. Right now, my shorthand for this is, what are our next two stacks?

733
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:49.319
Jerry Michalski: And try to figure out what is a set of, of…

734
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:57.299
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Ways of doing decisions and making collective decisions as a society and solving problems.

735
01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:05.830
Jerry Michalski: What is a way of open sourcing those things so that communities can just grab them and implement them, as opposed to telling everybody to do X or Y or Z?

736
01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:14.970
Jerry Michalski: Because I think people are rejecting mandates left, right, and center, so how do we make things so functional and so appealing that,

737
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:18.500
Jerry Michalski: I don't know that I know Neighborhoodos, Kalia, thank you.

738
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:20.219
Jerry Michalski: I'm gonna go look it up.

739
01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.929
Jerry Michalski: How do we… how do we…

740
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:31.869
Jerry Michalski: How do we put on offer a bunch of things that we know work in some places, and then make it very, very easy for other communities to implement them?

741
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:41.229
Jerry Michalski: And in a non-political way, because the left-right party system is stuck in everything we've been talking about for 87 minutes.

742
01:24:43.450 --> 01:25:01.789
Jerry Michalski: Right? And so, how do… how do we make some alternate way of living together and making an abundant society happen, that then grows up from the bottom? And then if somebody wants to make a political party out of that, great, but they'll at least have some foundation to work from.

743
01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:19.229
Doug Breitbart: I, I think, I think… There's a… there's an orientational… Shift… That's… that's not about… Ways of doing things.

744
01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:26.670
Doug Breitbart: I really think there's a… What's… what's been lost?

745
01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.439
Doug Breitbart: What's missing in technology?

746
01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:36.669
Doug Breitbart: And what's missing in… The capitalist system, which is really at the root of a lot of this.

747
01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:46.160
Doug Breitbart: Is any moral, ethical, or value orientation transcendent of individual interest?

748
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:52.950
Doug Breitbart: Relative to the capitalist driver, which is profit.

749
01:25:54.900 --> 01:26:05.070
Doug Breitbart: And, all of the structures and all of the… Ways in ways

750
01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:10.249
Doug Breitbart: Underlying moral, ethical value considerations and empathy.

751
01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.220
Doug Breitbart: It's a fundamental human… Caring.

752
01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:25.160
Doug Breitbart: Were supported, had to do with the… the actual… societal fabric.

753
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:31.209
Doug Breitbart: Supporting connection between people, caring Of people for other people.

754
01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.160
Doug Breitbart: And all of that's been sort of denatured out of the system.

755
01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:45.600
Doug Breitbart: And… The question is, how to sort of…

756
01:26:46.050 --> 01:26:49.380
Doug Breitbart: Not provide… you can't provide that.

757
01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:55.629
Doug Breitbart: But what I think and believe is that We… we can spark it.

758
01:26:56.930 --> 01:27:08.209
Doug Breitbart: And that the feelings that are in that domain of empathy and… Care and value, and ethic.

759
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:12.490
Doug Breitbart: Feels better.

760
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:17.540
Doug Breitbart: And that the younger generations today

761
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:36.600
Doug Breitbart: are actually… there's a vacuum where that belongs, where that exists, where that can be catalyzed, and anything that could come along to offer that, I think, would explode like what happened in the 60s, except for those generations.

762
01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:39.530
Doug Breitbart: I don't think they're sold less.

763
01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.259
Doug Breitbart: But if you look and watch at what, culturally, they're…

764
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.779
Doug Breitbart: Swimming around it, and it sure looks like it.

765
01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.540
Doug Breitbart: But I think they're… they recognize the absence of.

766
01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:59.500
Doug Breitbart: I think they're feeling the absence of. I don't think anybody's offering them Bat.

767
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:15.749
Jerry Michalski: By some quirk of fate, we are right at the end of our call time, but that sounds like a really lovely thing, a lovely note to end our call on.

768
01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.660
Jerry Michalski: I'm afraid we won't have Ken Homer around for a bit.

769
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:25.639
Jerry Michalski: So we are poemless at the end of our call, which I… leaves a little gap in my heart.

770
01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:34.080
Jerry Michalski: But thank you for, joining in wholeheartedly in this conversation. I really, I really appreciate it.

771
01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:37.870
Jerry Michalski: feedback, afterthoughts, put them on the OGM mailing list.

772
01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:42.330
Jerry Michalski: And let's see where this goes.

773
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:50.300
Jerry Michalski: Kalia, does it make sense to have an OGM call about verifiable Communities, so we can learn more and understand what the initiative is?

774
01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:55.279
Kaliya Identity Woman: Or if you want to invite Grace.

775
01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.240
Jerry Michalski: That'd be great.

776
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:00.040
Kaliya Identity Woman: Yeah.

777
01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:01.690
Jerry Michalski: Cool.

778
01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:08.389
Kaliya Identity Woman: She's just about to have a whole deck about the initiative, so that's good timing.

779
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:10.539
Jerry Michalski: She's just about to have a what?

780
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:11.900
Kaliya Identity Woman: A deck.

781
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:14.530
Jerry Michalski: A deck? Super. That is good timing.

782
01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.750
Jerry Michalski: Awesome.

783
01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:21.369
Jerry Michalski: So close.

784
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:26.389
Jerry Michalski: Thank you all. This has been,

785
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:31.460
Jerry Michalski: Really informative, groovy, and slightly frightening call.

786
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.140
Jerry Michalski: I will see you on the inner tubes and, in another week.
