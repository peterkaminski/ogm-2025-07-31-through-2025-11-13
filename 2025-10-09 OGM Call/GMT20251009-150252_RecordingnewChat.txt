00:13:25	Jerry Michalski:	It appears to me that we (the OGM community) and We (the internet-connected fraction of humanity) are moving through a fascinating inflection point in how we think (individually), communicate (with each other), and think (collectively).
It recently occurred to me that our use of LLMs has resulted in an explosion of 1:1 conversations (ourselves with an artificial partner) that can be remarkably generative and reflective... but they remain very difficult to share.
Each of these "private" 1:1 conversations carries dense context, subtle evolution of thought, and a sense of intimacy that resists summarization. The result is a proliferation of private insight without an easy pathway to collective sensemaking.
As many OGM community members have candidly observed:  "I don't have the time or interest for you to tell me about the conversation that you had with an LLM... I had one too!  Do you want to hear about it?"
00:13:27	Jerry Michalski:	Only recently did it occur to me to ask (ChatGPT):  When will we be able to invite an LLM to participate as an active, real-time participant in a group conversation (beyond just being a notetaker or post-conversation synthesizer)?
It sounds like technological advances in voice recognition, conversational threading, and contextual reasoning will allow LLMs to recognize multiple speakers, follow complex dialogues, and contribute meaningfully when invited within the next couple years.
This makes me wonder, not just how they will contribute, but also when and why.
How will the LLM discern the right moment to offer a perspective, maintain a coherent “persona,” and respect the rhythm of human dialogue?
How do we/We?
Onward,
John

Me too. I think it is learnable
