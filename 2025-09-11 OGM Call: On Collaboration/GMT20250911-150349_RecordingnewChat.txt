I think my questioning revolves around people using “collaboration” as a term when they really mean teamwork or cooperation. 

Along the way I began thinking if I had experienced or seen collaborative projects, and I realized that the use of the word feels vastly more frequent than the action of collaborating.

I would say a jazz quartet is a collaboration, because if you change the musicians, it changes the outcome. We name the musicians. We typically do not name the musicians in a marching band, and they are playing a set piece. Cooperation and teamwork absolutely, but not collaboration.

00:39:37	Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach:	That’s clearer, Scott, and we probably agree on that ;-)
00:40:08	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area:	From etymology online:

collaborate(v.)

1845 (implied in collaborating), "to work with another or others," a back-formation from collaborator or else modeled on French collaborer or directly from Late Latin collaboratus, past participle of collaborare. Given a bad sense in World War II: "Cooperate traitorously with an occupying enemy."
00:40:09	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area:	collaboration(n.)

1830, "act of working together, united labor" (especially in literature or scientific study), from French collaboration, noun of action from past-participle stem of Latin collaborare "work with," from assimilated form of com "with" (see com-) + laborare"to work" (see labor (v.)).
In a bad sense, "traitorous cooperation with an occupying enemy," it is recorded from 1940; earliest references are to the Vichy Government of France. Collaborationist was used disparagingly in socialist jargon from 1922.
00:41:16	Pete Kaminski:	As an American who started a "collaboration software" company in the early 2000's, I learned that "collaboration" has a completely different historical connotation in Europe, especially France, than in the US.

In WWII, "collaborators" (collaborateurs) and "collaborationists" (collaborationnistes) were the words used for French people who were working with the Nazis.

00:47:17	Pete Kaminski:	Replying to "As an American who s..."

"Collaboration" was the word Socialtext used to describe the way our software helped people work together and share knowledge.

I'm not sure we had a lot of philosophy about what the word meant, but it was useful to distinguish Socialtext wikis from Powerpoint / MS Word / Outlook.

We did get pushback from European customers on the word. As ChatGPT puts it, 'Today, the term "collaboration" in France still evokes memories of wartime betrayal. While in many contexts it retains its neutral or positive meaning, in political or historical discussions, it can imply complicity or treason.'
00:48:03	Shawn Murphy:	Replying to "As an American who s..."

OMG!  Wartime betrayal!!!  Magnificent example
00:48:07	Jerry Michalski:	Replying to "As an American who s..."

00:49:00	Scott Moehring:	Collective Flow. Where you are so in sync with another person that you lose your sense of self, time is altered, and the result is magnetic, authentic for both (or all), and more than what they could have described beforehand.

Some of my peak human experiences were dual-level collaborations, where I was on a 4-5 person technical sales team, collaborating with a similar-sized purchasing team.

Each team was a collaboration in itself, with each of us on the sales team working sort of like soccer or basketball players, passing the ball back and forth, looking for openings and setback.

The purchasing team was doing the same on their side.

And then, the two teams collaborating and competed, working to decide whether or not there would be a purchase, and how to make a fair deal where each side felt like they were winning as well.
