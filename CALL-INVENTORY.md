   - Participant counts
   - Key themes
2. Extract participant names from transcripts
3. Build participant attendance matrix
4. Create topic clustering
5. Analyze check-in patterns

## Notes

- Call 16 (2025-11-13 Part 2) appears to be missing AI summary
- Closed captions (.cc.vtt) begin appearing from Call 05 onward
- Need to determine if Parts 1 & 2 of Nov 13 should be treated as:
  - Two separate calls (current approach)
  - Single call with two sessions
  - Decision will affect numbering and cross-references
