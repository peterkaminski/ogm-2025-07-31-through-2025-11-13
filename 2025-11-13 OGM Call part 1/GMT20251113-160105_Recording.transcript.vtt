1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.729
Jerry Michalski: This is the Open Global Mind weekly call on Thursday, November 13th, 2025.

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.099
Jerry Michalski: We have a fun topic today.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.649
Jerry Michalski: Which is, what happened to curiosity?

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.910
Jerry Michalski: I think I have a funny feeling that many of us have

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.019
Jerry Michalski: Our own theories about this, our own hypotheses.

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.589
Jerry Michalski: So I'm interested, maybe, in collecting up a couple of those before we go in.

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:36.069
Jerry Michalski: Victoria has put a link in the chat, which we may need to put in a couple times, because as people come into the room, they don't see the previous chat, so we'll probably have to repeat it.

8
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:46.429
Jerry Michalski: But Victoria went to town on an Excalibra board that is multi-user, so everybody can go look at it. Maybe a thing I can do…

9
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.300
Kevin Jones: Actually…

10
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.579
Jerry Michalski: Definitely a thing I can do is screen share mine… my screen, so that everybody can see it on mine for a moment.

11
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.109
Jerry Michalski: So here is… The Excalibur drawboard, I see that several people are already in it.

12
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.579
Jerry Michalski: And, you can scroll around.

13
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:16.009
Jerry Michalski: And this looks way more interesting and elaborate than when it started, which was, I guess, yesterday morning. So, fabulous, love this work.

14
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:26.959
Jerry Michalski: And, I think everybody can go ahead and add things. I believe, and Victoria, if you want to do a tutorial, let me know, and you can take over, but just for the moment.

15
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.610
Jerry Michalski: If you wanted to add a box with some comments, see the little menu at the top, click on the rectangle.

16
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.189
Jerry Michalski: And then,

17
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:48.590
Jerry Michalski: basically make a box, and start typing in it, and give it a color. Over here is the color selection, if you want to, to sort of fit the mood and method of the whole thing. I'm gonna eliminate… I'm gonna try to…

18
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.339
Jerry Michalski: Delete my box, there we go.

19
00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:01.079
Jerry Michalski: And it's pretty straightforward, and the settings right now are so that lines look like they're a little hand-drawn, and the text is a nice handwritten sort of text, which gives the whole…

20
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.229
Jerry Michalski: Excalibraw board, a nice feeling of, of sort of human… Humanity and,

21
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.499
Jerry Michalski: Looks like it was created by people drawing on a board, which is very, very nice.

22
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.700
Jerry Michalski: And just…

23
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:23.349
Victoria (Spain): to make everyone comfortable, I have a copy of this State of the board. So, if everything is messed, it doesn't matter.

24
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:33.180
Jerry Michalski: Beautiful! So, Victoria has taken a snapshot, and we're off to the races. So, riff on this, add to it, do whatever. Victoria, anything you want to add to what I just described?

25
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.600
Victoria (Spain): Well, my only… Remark is what it's at the top left corner.

26
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:50.680
Victoria (Spain): because… In that… in… in the mail, We were given many solutions.

27
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.120
Victoria (Spain): And closing very early the problem.

28
00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:05.410
Victoria (Spain): And that's not what we should strive for. We should strive for open as many questions as possible. So if instead of saying.

29
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.009
Victoria (Spain): Education closes curiosity. We state it as a question.

30
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.909
Victoria (Spain): Does education close up?

31
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.589
Victoria (Spain): Then we will have more things to work with.

32
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.849
Jerry Michalski: Sounds great. I tend to think of it as just the positing of multiple theories instead of the choosing of one.

33
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.190
Victoria (Spain): What?

34
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.640
Jerry Michalski: Close it down.

35
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:39.329
Victoria (Spain): The thing is, gathering all the opinions, but trying to show that we are not closing, but opening.

36
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.260
Jerry Michalski: Perfect. Sounds great.

37
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:52.989
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, thank you. So, with that, I'll stop my screen share and hope that everybody can follow the links and get, into the Excalodraw.

38
00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:02.369
Jerry Michalski: And see if anybody wants to take an opening step, or… Victoria, if you want to take an opening step into the conversation, that would be great, too.

39
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.140
Victoria (Spain): Well, for me, as you have seen, it's,

40
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:19.129
Victoria (Spain): like, an ongoing theme? Like, when I first talked to you, Jerry, and you said that trust and consumerism were your things.

41
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.840
Victoria (Spain): So, the other day, I understood that this also has been always a concern for me.

42
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:40.090
Victoria (Spain): And seeing how it exploded in the community, I thought, okay, instead of each of us, like, taking it to one place or another.

43
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:54.410
Victoria (Spain): why don't we get everything inside, so we can maybe decide we can work, because here today I have, the issue of access that links with the

44
00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.620
Victoria (Spain): The fact that you say, books are, like, fossil knowledge?

45
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.270
Victoria (Spain): It's trapped. There are also the silos.

46
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:15.839
Victoria (Spain): the academia, that you need subscriptions, paid subscriptions to… so, there are a lot of things going on, so maybe…

47
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:24.029
Victoria (Spain): we must, like, gather everything, and start thinking how this relates to different OGM projects.

48
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.859
Victoria (Spain): Or maybe different things that can start from here.

49
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.650
Victoria (Spain): So the… my…

50
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.119
Victoria (Spain): I wanted to link this issue with the other issues that are going around in the community.

51
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.120
Jerry Michalski: Brilliant. Thank you, that's great. I love that.

52
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.640
Jerry Michalski: Kevin, please.

53
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.379
Kevin Jones: Is the premise that we are losing, or curiosity is being diminished?

54
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.470
Kevin Jones: If that's it, I completely disagree, so I'm curious.

55
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.739
Jerry Michalski: I, I think, I think the question started as, hey, kids in school seem incurious.

56
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:25.220
Jerry Michalski: things like that are happening, like, are we losing curiosity? And I think, in general, the room will agree with you that, no, no, no. And in particular, we have a selection bias problem here, which is that I think everybody in this room is, like, really, really curious, and probably hangs out with really curious people.

57
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.079
Jerry Michalski: But, Victoria, I don't know if you want to address that, or anybody else.

58
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.429
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'll say something on it. Oh, Scott, sorry, you were too ahead of me.

59
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.390
Jerry Michalski: Oh, I guess I hit my buzzer faster than you.

60
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.380
Scott Moehring: What… what struck me as interesting in this, I agree with you, Jerry, that we have a

61
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.970
Scott Moehring: a bias of the people in the room, because this room attracts those kinds of people, and my art.

62
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.749
Scott Moehring: Argument would be that this group tends to be high in openness.

63
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.660
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So if we look at the Big Five personality model, which is the…

64
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.170
Scott Moehring: We're a statistically verified model of personality.

65
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.750
Scott Moehring: Openness is one of the five dimensions.

66
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:17.429
Scott Moehring: And that to mention, is… People who tend to be creative, interested in intellectual pursuits.

67
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.339
Scott Moehring: Open to new things and new ways, curious.

68
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.310
Scott Moehring: And it exists on a spectrum.

69
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.729
Scott Moehring: There are people who are low in openness.

70
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.460
Scott Moehring: And neither end of the spectrum is…

71
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.640
Scott Moehring: Evolutionarily better, which is why we have

72
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:42.270
Scott Moehring: the spectrum. Sometimes you need to be less open, and you need to be more…

73
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.190
Scott Moehring: Literal, or more practical, or more…

74
00:07:49.080 --> 00:08:04.570
Scott Moehring: tradition, or history, or ritual. And sometimes you need to be more open, and more accepting, and more combining, and more far-reaching, and that sort of thing, which is why my understanding of it is why we have both ends. But my thought is, is that

75
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:13.409
Scott Moehring: If we're looking for people who are… or if we're seeing things where evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to notice that

76
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.379
Scott Moehring: all of those instances where people are less curious, and I think those are the people who are

77
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.789
Scott Moehring: Less on the open side, and… that I,

78
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.160
Scott Moehring: I tend to agree that it's not… I haven't seen a sea change in that, but that was one thing I wanted to put out there, is that I believe it exists on a…

79
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.169
Scott Moehring: a range, and that's… the Big Five model kind of supports that.

80
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.030
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Scott.

81
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.549
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Gil, please.

82
00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:48.649
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, yeah, I've raised this a couple of times out of personal experience, which may have all kinds of selection bias in it. I've observed

83
00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:59.779
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: The initial assessment that I formed was that… was that people much younger than me were not curious, and how that showed up is conversations with them.

84
00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:04.539
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Where I would ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions.

85
00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:14.359
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which I found perplexing. And I found this even more striking in networking situations, where you're meeting somebody at a conference and you're chatting.

86
00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:19.879
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I've been really struck at how one-way those conversations have been.

87
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:23.979
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And so I've taken recently to,

88
00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:35.579
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: doing something I've never done before, like, start to talk about things. In the course of meeting someone new, I'll start to talk about what I'm up to, what I'm doing, what I want to talk about, what I would have wanted to be asked about.

89
00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:47.769
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And then the conversation proceeds kind of normally, they're interested, and there's back and forth, but the initiation, what I'm calling curiosity of asking questions about somebody else, what they're thinking, interested in, doing, or so forth.

90
00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:57.729
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm noticing it in its absence, but to qualify what I just said, I was remembering last night, we… Jane and I had dinner.

91
00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:03.139
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: A few months ago with a person who we've known since she was, like, 12.

92
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:17.159
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But she's now 55, or something like that. And, she made us a lovely buffet. We had spent the afternoon in her backyard, spent about… spent about 3 hours together.

93
00:10:17.469 --> 00:10:22.699
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And she didn't ask a single question of us.

94
00:10:23.349 --> 00:10:28.679
Jerry Michalski: How we doing? How's your life? How's your health? She knows that Jane has been going through major health issues for many years.

95
00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:31.909
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: To somebody who knows her and loves her.

96
00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:32.989
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And…

97
00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:52.099
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: didn't ask anything. I was really… I was… I became increasingly uncomfortable. I was really baffled. I didn't figure out what was weird until afterwards, but I've never been in a situation like that. So that… it echoes the question about curiosity. It challenges my assumption that it's a phenomenon of younger people, because

98
00:10:52.359 --> 00:10:56.859
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: she's, you know, not younger, she's younger than us, but she's not young. So,

99
00:10:57.169 --> 00:11:08.539
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And one… let me throw one more data point into this, which is an old one. So, early on in Natural Logic, we were doing lots of site assessments of companies, looking at efficiency.

100
00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:13.619
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And footprint reduction opportunities. And,

101
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:22.259
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: One of my junior staff members, who's actually not so junior, like, you know, an engineer, smart.

102
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.580
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Analytical, had been with me on a number of these, and he finally went out on one of his own.

103
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:34.780
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And when he came back, I was really struck at how… at all kinds of information that he hadn't gathered.

104
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.870
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And we kind of unpacked what he talked with the staff at the company about, and…

105
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.969
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I would say, well, did you ask him about ABC? He said, God, I didn't think of that.

106
00:11:46.760 --> 00:12:03.590
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, this is maybe not curiosity, but it's a… it's a… the map of distinctions that leads somebody on a trail of investigation. It was very striking how different his, what I called, curiosity was, and how we had to kind of, you know, train him up.

107
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.529
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And being curious, investigating.

108
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:14.130
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Let me stop there. There's more to say, but I want to not hog the mic here. I'll stop there.

109
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:34.139
Jerry Michalski: Gil, I'm really appreciating your first-person stories. I really like that, you know, this person is doing this, because I'm coming into this partly from having read a few too many stories about how incurious recent graduates seem to be when they come into work, which leads us into the education conversation. Is something happening to our kids who are busy cramming but not learning?

110
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:45.160
Jerry Michalski: Have we stamped out, sort of, inquisitiveness in the schooling system? And that… and we'll go there, but I think there's lots of other things going on that your stories are pointing to. Go ahead.

111
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:59.440
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And let me just say one other thing before I yield to Alex. I put a note in the chat. I'm an etymology geek, so I started quickly looking for etymology and found this thing saying, well, there's this curious etymology, curious etymology. Curiosity relates to care.

112
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:13.909
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And so in this formulation, they're saying its origins reveal a deeper truth. To be curious is to care enough to pay attention. So that may be a false trail, or that may be a relevant piece of this conversation, I don't know.

113
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.690
Jerry Michalski: That's lovely. I think that the etymology is important as well.

114
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.319
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And Victoria, thank you, I stuck that into the drawing.

115
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.100
Jerry Michalski: Beautiful.

116
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.700
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Maybe not.

117
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.550
Jerry Michalski: I saw that you did that.

118
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.399
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There it is.

119
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.600
Jerry Michalski: Excellent. Alex, please.

120
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.780
Alex Kladitis: Thanks. I suddenly realized I didn't have it.

121
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.280
Alex Kladitis: So…

122
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:47.060
Alex Kladitis: The points that have been made so far are very… sorry, not very… they're on the academic side of curiosity.

123
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:53.170
Alex Kladitis: my… I thought when we first mentioned it, we'd start talking about

124
00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:00.489
Alex Kladitis: The curiosity, in the sense that we're so polarized that each side, or whoever it is.

125
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:00.880
John Warinner: Top.

126
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:10.689
Alex Kladitis: And I can go through the recordings, and I can find every single… sorry, not every single… at least one example where each one of you has made a statement, and I'm thinking.

127
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.299
Alex Kladitis: But why don't you look at it from this point of view?

128
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:27.810
Alex Kladitis: And it'll disprove your statement, okay? Every single one of you, I'm sure, I'll come up with. It's inherent in us. We want to feel good, so it depends on the topics. If it's politics, and we're on the left or the right, we don't want to

129
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.629
Alex Kladitis: Challenge our mental model and belief system.

130
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.390
Alex Kladitis: So that's one of the obstacles to being curious.

131
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:41.720
Alex Kladitis: And it really puzzles me, because… and many people have said this in the Twittersphere or whatever.

132
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.970
Alex Kladitis: Wherever it is, that it's really amazing that we as humans.

133
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.700
Alex Kladitis: We'll go to page 1, and we'll read about some politicians announcing a new this, that, and the other.

134
00:14:52.970 --> 00:15:00.450
Alex Kladitis: And say how great the politician is, if we support them. And then we'll go to number 5, you know, page 5 of a newspaper.

135
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:08.310
Alex Kladitis: And there's an article of what shy says the politicians are. And we can compartmentalize the two and not cross-feed

136
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.190
Alex Kladitis: If he's a shyster over there, if that part is lying over there.

137
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.560
Alex Kladitis: what tells you that they tell the truth here? And that, to me, it's curiosity, or…

138
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.989
Alex Kladitis: maybe I'm using the wrong word, which amazes me, because I do it, and I'm sure everybody else does it.

139
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:31.380
Alex Kladitis: And yet, we know it. You know, it's sort of, so the other thing was about the young. I have personal experience with my kids.

140
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.880
Alex Kladitis: I… what can I say?

141
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.730
Alex Kladitis: I enjoy talking.

142
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.169
Alex Kladitis: Discussing things with them, if there's no…

143
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:49.430
Alex Kladitis: belief system involved, be it politics, religion, whatever it is. We have a great conversation. But as soon as we start discussing things we care about.

144
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.650
Alex Kladitis: And remember, the mechanic here is, oh, Dad's an old what's-it, so he's not going to think about it the way as us.

145
00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.209
Alex Kladitis: But what amazes me is their reluctance

146
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:16.779
Alex Kladitis: to even hear or question what the belief system… something that might challenge the belief system. It really is amazing, and I do think, Jerry, you mentioned it, it's to do with, the way we've been taught, and it isn't something that's just happened, I think it's happened over time, that we kind of…

147
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:30.500
Alex Kladitis: Maybe it's the influence of TV, because it's an acceptance machine, and on TV, you don't actually challenge anything, you just watch and enjoy. You don't interact with it, or something like that, maybe a radio as well. Maybe how the technology's grown, but

148
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:37.900
Alex Kladitis: young people… I think it's a teaching system, or what the te… they don't… they're not… the Fed information.

149
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.270
Alex Kladitis: And I always used to think… I always used to think I was challenged at school to think differently.

150
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.950
Alex Kladitis: But maybe I wasn't, I don't know. But that was the,

151
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.200
Alex Kladitis: That was the point I wanted to see, is that we're all doing this.

152
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.489
Alex Kladitis: Every day, even in this call, we will do it.

153
00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.390
Alex Kladitis: That we're not… I… you guys call it curiosity, I call it…

154
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.629
Alex Kladitis: The not-standard, or what you see in front of you, point of view.

155
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.800
Alex Kladitis: Oh, that was it. That was me. Have you considered yourself all told off?

156
00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.629
Alex Kladitis: For not being perfect. Totally.

157
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:24.720
Jerry Michalski: Totally, Alex, thank you. I'm thinking, at first, I am noticing that my image is flashing green every now and then. I think it's my little USB hub, which is…

158
00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:38.289
Jerry Michalski: Not happy that I've got the microphone plugged in as well as the camera through it, so I'm gonna troubleshoot that, but in case you're like, what's going on with Jerry? It's not that I'm coming, phoning in from a different planet, it's that some of my systems are not cooperating properly.

159
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.829
Jerry Michalski: Alex, I think

160
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:58.840
Jerry Michalski: piece of what you're pointing to, I would have called critical thinking, and I'm also realizing that we could have replaced the word curiosity with the phrase critical thinking in the invite to today's call, and probably would have gotten a similar showing. And maybe that's a topic for future… it's adjacent, as Gil says, you know, right after.

161
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.519
Jerry Michalski: Right after my thing. Scott's unsure.

162
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.480
Jerry Michalski: But…

163
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:12.869
Jerry Michalski: there's a… there's a piece of what I think you're raising, Alex, which is about our identity, and our self-image, and the preservation of self.

164
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:24.459
Jerry Michalski: or the… or even… or even the development of self, and how… what we… who we think we are and where we think we stand. And I think there's an interesting bit of conversation here about

165
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:38.029
Jerry Michalski: Are we now afraid to take a stand? Are we confused about where the stands are? Do we think that taking a stand has become dangerous, because of the level of… the poor level of discourse out there in the public arena?

166
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:48.090
Jerry Michalski: Are we afraid of being canceled, or afraid of being pounded, or trolled, or whatever else? And those all seem, you know, more or less legitimate in the current environment.

167
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.500
Jerry Michalski: Let me go to Pete. And Alex, if you'll take your hand down from before.

168
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.909
Jerry Michalski: Pete, please.

169
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:02.060
Pete Kaminski: Thank you, Jerry. And, Alex, thanks for telling us all off. I appreciate it.

170
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.679
Pete Kaminski: I… I guess I wanted to say that I don't…

171
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:23.710
Pete Kaminski: I see declines in curiosity, but I think we… I also see, increases in curiosity, too. So I think it… it changes… the landscape keeps changing. I certainly know there are places where we kill curiosity.

172
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:32.700
Pete Kaminski: Living in an entertainment culture where you're supposed to sit back and consume, but not participate.

173
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:46.540
Pete Kaminski: is obviously a bad thing. The way that we do education, I, you know, as a kid growing up in school, there were lots of ways teachers killed my curiosity.

174
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.410
Pete Kaminski: And… and worse for other people in my classes.

175
00:19:51.410 --> 00:20:04.210
Pete Kaminski: I wanted to… the reason I raised my hand and wanted to say something was because of Gil's story about the person that he and Jane know, that didn't ask, didn't ask

176
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:11.889
Pete Kaminski: you know, about them. And it reminds me… I learned from Joanne, my wife,

177
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:28.490
Pete Kaminski: to be able to have, to be able to be curious and have a conversation with somebody, even if maybe you don't care in the grander scheme of things, or you're shy, or whatever. I'm… I'm kind of shy.

178
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:49.120
Pete Kaminski: And it's just a rote thing, right? It's just human and polite, to be sitting with somebody and to ask them, you know, you know, how's your life? Do you have pets? Do you have friends? You know, where did you grow up? Those kinds of things. It's not hard to do.

179
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.360
Pete Kaminski: And…

180
00:20:51.100 --> 00:21:05.719
Pete Kaminski: I know I went from somebody who didn't have that as a skill that I was ever taught, really, by my parents, or my peers, or my school. I learned that very quickly from Joanne. And so…

181
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:28.770
Pete Kaminski: one of, certainly some curiosity is innate. I've got a lot of innate curiosity, and probably most of the people in this… in this room do. The place where I see that most nowadays is actually, working with AI. I've spent a lot of time showing people how, you know, this AI thing, and there are a lot of people who…

182
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:40.839
Pete Kaminski: they play with it for a little bit, and it doesn't do anything interesting, and then they're done. And, you know, I'm like, well, I'm… I… when I tried playing with it, it was actually hard work, I remember.

183
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:58.599
Pete Kaminski: having to sit down and go, okay, what can I do with it now? What crazy thing could I give it, you know? You know, I used to do things like write poetry in three different languages, come up with a short story that starts with blah, come up with, you know, all kinds of crazy stuff.

184
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:10.050
Pete Kaminski: And it was not second nature to do that with this new, information tool. It was something I had to work through, but…

185
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:17.570
Pete Kaminski: I was so curious about, I worked through it. And I see a lot of people bouncing off new technology, because of that.

186
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:32.549
Pete Kaminski: Same thing, you know, when people adopted the internet. Same thing when people adopted PCs. You know, I was an early adopter of those, and I was like, you know, I don't know what it does, but let me find out. Let me try to break it, let me try to do crazy stuff with it. Can it do this? Can it do that?

187
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.590
Pete Kaminski: So…

188
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:47.659
Pete Kaminski: some… some is definitely innate. Some curiosity is definitely innate, but another thing that Gil's story made me realize is some curiosity is a social practice.

189
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.100
Pete Kaminski: you know, I…

190
00:22:49.200 --> 00:23:01.470
Pete Kaminski: Somewhere in our world, it ought to end up that you get taught by your peers, or your school, or your parents, or somebody, you know, here's some things that you can do to…

191
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:15.510
Pete Kaminski: enact curiosity, even if you're not particularly interested, just enact it as a social practice, because it helps everybody. You know, it helps, it helps people feel good when you talk about them. It helps people…

192
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:28.489
Pete Kaminski: It helps you learn stuff that you wouldn't have known otherwise when you're, you know, got a few hours riding in a carriage, or in an airplane, or whatever we do nowadays.

193
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.450
Pete Kaminski: So that was what I wanted to say. Thanks.

194
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.120
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Pete.

195
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.200
Jerry Michalski: Stacy.

196
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.840
Stacey Druss: Thanks, Pete. I have to address what you said first, or maybe second.

197
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:50.310
Stacey Druss: Yeah, I'll do… I'll do that after.

198
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.739
Stacey Druss: Or maybe I… you maybe have to get that out of the way first.

199
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.370
Stacey Druss: I'm just on the other side of, yeah.

200
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:04.990
Stacey Druss: Curiosity, when it's not genuine, can also be really annoying.

201
00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:15.559
Stacey Druss: It's, it's like… Yeah, let me just get that off my chest, because it… At least for me.

202
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.759
Stacey Druss: I don't know if it's… if I want to say as a woman or not.

203
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.190
Stacey Druss: As someone who sometimes feels or has felt disempowered.

204
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:35.439
Stacey Druss: Sometimes curiosity can feel like I have to explain myself.

205
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.649
Stacey Druss: So I just want to put that out there.

206
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.220
Jerry Michalski: And she was, like, crying?

207
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.360
Stacey Druss: Say it again?

208
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.590
Jerry Michalski: It feels like prying, you mean, or…

209
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:50.620
Stacey Druss: Yeah, or, like, having to justify why I'm doing what I'm doing. When it's genuine, it's wonderful.

210
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.810
Pete Kaminski: And if I may, when I learned

211
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.090
Pete Kaminski: this kind of social curiosity from Joyan.

212
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.060
Pete Kaminski: Her observation as a woman was…

213
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:15.920
Pete Kaminski: men are acculturated to not be curious, especially about women, about lots of stuff, right? And so, in a way, it was a kind of women's work that she doesn't mind doing because it's not the worst thing that women have to do in this world. But…

214
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:33.440
Pete Kaminski: she was always… she felt like she was always the one who were like, you know, it's not that hard, guys. Just ask questions. And you're… you're entirely correct. Insincere curiosity is… is worse than just shutting up. However.

215
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:44.810
Pete Kaminski: I would also say, it's… it's not hard at all to learn to ask humbly and be genuinely interested in the answer, where did you grow up? You know, it's not…

216
00:25:45.830 --> 00:26:03.080
Pete Kaminski: it's… it's, I can ask that question and not care about the answer, but it's not hard as a social practice for me to say, I really do care where you grew up. And I hope you ask if… where I grew up too, but, you know, if you don't, I understand that you're not…

217
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:10.939
Pete Kaminski: you're not as careful as I am, or you're not as polite, or whatever, I'm gonna, like, shine that on. And I know women have to do that a lot more than men, so…

218
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:23.180
Stacey Druss: Yeah, and you know, I'm probably the wrong person, because I'm not doing anything I don't want to do. So I'm sorry, anybody. I don't pro… I probably don't care where you live, so somebody else will ask you.

219
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:39.969
Pete Kaminski: Well, you ask even better questions, Stacy, but, you know, there's a set of, like, five questions that even a man can learn, you know? Ask this question, really care about the answer, and there's probably a follow-up question, you know? Where did you go to school? You know, it's pretty simple to use.

220
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:40.849
Stacey Druss: Let me, let me, let me.

221
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:46.450
Pete Kaminski: I'm sorry to have interrupted you. Now I'm curious what you're going to say.

222
00:26:46.450 --> 00:27:02.319
Stacey Druss: Okay, this is what I want to… I want to go back to… I want to connect to where Gil was speaking, because I… so I was reminded of, George Mombia, where he says, where we don't have the story, we make up one, and I want to connect

223
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.520
Stacey Druss: to Gil's stories.

224
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:10.630
Stacey Druss: So, when he was speaking about, like, coaching and… I was thinking.

225
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:28.119
Stacey Druss: So, the people that don't ask questions then, the story that I made up in my mind, is that sometimes people that are either younger, or if I could replace that with less experience, because they might be the same age, but they might be less experienced.

226
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:43.110
Stacey Druss: Sometimes they haven't had the space to talk, and so they don't want to ask questions and hear experience, because they are just dying to have somebody hear them. So I want to throw that out.

227
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:57.289
Stacey Druss: And as far as the people that were talking to Jane, sometimes people are afraid to hear the answers, and they're so uncomfortable with sickness, and they don't want to know.

228
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:04.120
Stacey Druss: And I wanted to throw that out, too, because sometimes really caring, loving people

229
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.039
Stacey Druss: Are just so uncomfortable with feelings and don't know what to say.

230
00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:24.189
Stacey Druss: And that calls in, you know, the curiosity kind of killed the cat thing, so sometimes we don't ask questions. Well, I'm looking at the lawyer in the corner. Doug, you're in the corner, and it's like, don't ask the question that you don't know the answer to.

231
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.659
Stacey Druss: So,

232
00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:37.129
Stacey Druss: those are some stories that came… some possible stories. I tend to be somebody… I will ask the question, because I don't want to make up a story in my head.

233
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:50.400
Stacey Druss: it's usually… I've found in my life, it's better to ask the question and know for sure than to just imagine what the answer is. And do I have any other questions? Anything? Okay, I think… I think I covered everything I wanted to say.

234
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.370
Stacey Druss: Over.

235
00:28:51.370 --> 00:29:03.749
Jerry Michalski: Hey, thank you, Stacy. You're reminding me of a conversation I'm having on LinkedIn, where I put a post in about futurists and future visions and how they're all kind of crappy, and a friend of mine posted in the comments about

236
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:14.799
Jerry Michalski: maybe we don't need future visions. Maybe what we need is to be really present. And it kind of flipped the game on me, and it was really interesting, because I find that…

237
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:26.740
Jerry Michalski: whatever model I have of where we're going, and the competing models of where we're going, I love that conversation and that battle, but I also find that my behavior changes enormously depending on what I think

238
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:33.209
Jerry Michalski: what I think I want in the future. I need those visions in order to figure out what… how to be present.

239
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:38.650
Jerry Michalski: And so, I haven't seen her response to that, but we're in the middle of that conversation right now, it's kind of cool.

240
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.819
Jerry Michalski: Mr. Jones, thanks for your patience.

241
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.009
Kevin Jones: Thank you.

242
00:29:42.030 --> 00:30:01.710
Kevin Jones: Well, you know, I think my success in life has been based on not paying attention in school, because I never could figure out what they wanted, and it didn't seem like much. But then when I got into business, I understood I was in a fluid, dynamic system that people were passionate about, and they were making things and buying things and selling things, and it was my briar patch.

243
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:06.490
Kevin Jones: And I'm running my friend Ben Santer, and his story, I think, is really relevant.

244
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:24.669
Kevin Jones: He was a PhD candidate who failed three times and was working in day labor in Seattle, and the one professor who still believed in him got him a gig of copying maps in an ag weather

245
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:36.389
Kevin Jones: company. And he suddenly understood climate, and it was a big enough thing, just like school wasn't big enough, climate was. He was the author of the first UN report on climate.

246
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:47.449
Kevin Jones: And one of the reasons he was the author is he had a really, you know, his ego was really in check, because he remembered he… if he hadn't had that one day labor come through, he would still be

247
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:56.689
Kevin Jones: you know, day laborers don't stay very stable, and so he was the one everybody trusted, and it was only when he… he just saw

248
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.039
Kevin Jones: you know, a weather map of Kansas.

249
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:17.630
Kevin Jones: and, you know, what was going to happen to Korn, and suddenly understood the system he was in. And, you know, he and I are similar in that way, is that, you know, again, not paying attention to school was a great gift, and… because I found the place where I did fit, you know, it was a…

250
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:26.400
Kevin Jones: fluid, dynamic system, you know, with elements of reciprocity. And so, men was the same way. So I think, you know.

251
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:35.570
Kevin Jones: I think you have to survive school, but I don't see people low… you know, it's just, they hadn't found the, you know, their briar patch, that's what I think.

252
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.380
Jerry Michalski: Hmm. Thanks, Kevin.

253
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.520
Jerry Michalski: Scott.

254
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.319
Scott Moehring: I want to throw a…

255
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:55.199
Scott Moehring: scatterbomb of different ideas, so I'm looking for a theme here. Alright, this is one I don't know.

256
00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.909
Scott Moehring: I like this idea that Pete had brought up about

257
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.419
Scott Moehring: asking people. I do it all the time. I talk to the people at the checkout line.

258
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.070
Scott Moehring: In the grocery store, and things like that.

259
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:15.709
Scott Moehring: I like to think as a 59-year-old, that I'm not that creepy old guy.

260
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.270
Scott Moehring: that I'm actually sincere, that I'm actually… we have a pleasant exchange, that I know a little something about them.

261
00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.910
Scott Moehring: What they're like, and… and it's… it's…

262
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.710
Scott Moehring: It's better than a simply pure transactional.

263
00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.909
Scott Moehring: I'm wondering, and this is the part that I don't know, is…

264
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:43.079
Scott Moehring: Are we… are our young people being raised to not do that?

265
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.580
Scott Moehring: because… We don't want to discriminate.

266
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.210
Scott Moehring: based on… Any of the discrimination

267
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:58.830
Scott Moehring: Factors that we shouldn't discriminate on, and that we shouldn't be intrusive, as you said, and that the idea of

268
00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.889
Scott Moehring: Sharing things about yourself.

269
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:07.740
Scott Moehring: Is more often, or can be used, especially online, for insult rather than connection.

270
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:12.240
Scott Moehring: And we're going to seek to avoid pain more than we are

271
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:21.970
Scott Moehring: towards pleasure. And the internet's forever, you know, and so online, if you share personal things about yourself.

272
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.140
Scott Moehring: They're… they're…

273
00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:31.680
Scott Moehring: Generally unneeded for the conversation that you're having, because it's about some other topic, or it's not germane.

274
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:43.379
Scott Moehring: It can be used against you, and maybe you… maybe that's part of it, personally, and the other part is that maybe we're taught, don't… don't ask those things, we are not supposed to…

275
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:51.150
Scott Moehring: inquire about… Race and religion and gender and all of those things, because it's… it causes trouble, and…

276
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:58.800
Scott Moehring: the last thought that I had that was all connected into that was that I… Met my wife online.

277
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.820
Scott Moehring: And I say often that it was the best thing.

278
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.179
Scott Moehring: The best thing, because I had to meet the person.

279
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.009
Scott Moehring: Before I could meet the person.

280
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:17.950
Scott Moehring: it stripped away all the… all the other stuff. I just had to… I had to get to know this individual.

281
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.560
Scott Moehring: And it has worked out extremely well because of that.

282
00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:28.689
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Scott.

283
00:34:28.939 --> 00:34:30.099
Jerry Michalski: Victoria.

284
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:47.169
Victoria (Spain): I just wanted to make a real follow-up on this conversation about caring by presenting you all my friend Gabrielle, who has joined us, because this.

285
00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:48.049
Gabriele G: equivalent.

286
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.079
Victoria (Spain): We were walking together.

287
00:34:50.650 --> 00:35:00.720
Victoria (Spain): he in Italy, I'm in Spain, but we were working together, and I asked… I told him about this session, and since he's young.

288
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.569
Victoria (Spain): So, this is a different perspective.

289
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:17.820
Victoria (Spain): And since he's studying to be a teacher or help people learn, I thought it was important that we can hear his voice, even if he's not raising the hand.

290
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.450
Victoria (Spain): That's odd.

291
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:30.649
Jerry Michalski: Victoria, thank you very much, and I was sort of looking for a place to say hi to Gabriele, and let him jump in. If you'd like to say anything or just introduce yourself, please feel free right now.

292
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:40.510
Gabriele G: Okay, thank you. It's so curious to be here, just the connection that happens, through internet.

293
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:51.720
Gabriele G: It's outstanding to me. I'm glad to hear your conversation. By now, I don't want to jump in, because…

294
00:35:52.070 --> 00:36:02.560
Gabriele G: I… I'm still trying to put my thoughts in order, but it's really…

295
00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:12.329
Gabriele G: Good things to be here. So, thank you for having, opened your door, internet door, for me, now.

296
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.880
Jerry Michalski: That's great, thank you. What city in Italy are you in?

297
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.979
Gabriele G: I am Padua, near Venice.

298
00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:22.859
Jerry Michalski: Very cool. Thank you, thank you so much.

299
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.680
Gabriele G: Thank you.

300
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.829
Jerry Michalski: Cool. Lp1, are you Don Bergen, or Louise King, or…

301
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.399
LP1: I'm Louise. Hello, everyone.

302
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.150
Jerry Michalski: You're Louise, okay. You look so much like my friend Don. That's very funny. Thanks for joining us, Louise.

303
00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:47.019
LP1: Yes, and I've joined today because I am, teaching… I'm teaching in an international section in a French lisse, and,

304
00:36:47.020 --> 00:37:08.860
LP1: I'm trying to decide whether I am seeing a decline in curiosity and confidence in my classroom, or whether it's just I'm getting old. We always hear that from, you know, the previous generation, or the young people today. They're not curious, they're not whatever.

305
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:22.080
LP1: But I would say that the last couple of years, I have really begun to wonder if it's me or if it's them. Some of the things I see is I do see

306
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:31.560
LP1: Many students lacking in confidence, they're asking some of the most basic things. Can I use color mist? Can I use whiteout?

307
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:45.669
LP1: Should I underline? Should I… and it's like, I have to say to them, you can make those decisions. They aren't challenging decisions, they're not important decisions. You can make those for yourself.

308
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:52.520
LP1: And I am seeing this anxiety of them, you know, making the simplest of moves.

309
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:59.200
LP1: The other one is, I really think I've seen a decline in attention.

310
00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:05.019
LP1: And, focus and involvement in tasks.

311
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:17.069
LP1: I was reflecting on a particular class that I gave an assessment to recently, and I've done the same assessment, perhaps, for the past 4 or 5 years, and literally, it's the very worst.

312
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:26.639
LP1: performance I've ever had. So I'm the same teacher in the room, and this is a reasonable performance across… I know there are lots of factors there.

313
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:39.989
LP1: So that's one of the reasons I'm here. I've got a bit of a thing about technology. I'm a maths teacher, and definitely with the use of calculators, I've seen a great decline in students' mental abilities.

314
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:50.869
LP1: Now, there is the feeling that that doesn't matter. They're using calculators, and as long as they can still think mathematically, it doesn't matter if they're not doing calculations, or they're not graphing, or they're not.

315
00:38:50.870 --> 00:39:04.929
LP1: But I wonder if it does diminish their mental capacity for understanding if they haven't done it themselves. So now I see them using ChatGPT to literally write their essays.

316
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:13.010
LP1: We're going to see a decline in the skills of, writing, of, expressing their ideas, in the written word.

317
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:26.740
LP1: Although, again, you could argue, does that matter? We're moving away from the printed word, we're moving back to, video, to the spoken word, spreading ideas through the spoken word. So, is it important if they can no longer.

318
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.639
iPhone (11): I should…

319
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.480
LP1: Right?

320
00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:41.650
LP1: So I'm full of all these… these questions about my situation. I did… I did have that thought that, because I see this, is curiosity innate, or can we teach it?

321
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:54.540
LP1: I try to teach problem solving. I see some students are just there, they just… they just have ideas, they try them out, it doesn't work, they'll try something different, they might be asking questions.

322
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.610
LP1: And I see other students who simply are there going, I don't know what to do. And I…

323
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:16.929
LP1: have never seen myself, despite I've tried hard, I've tried different methods, I've never seen a student learn how to problem solve. They either seem to have it, or they don't. They might be really great at lots of other things, so that's brilliant, but they're not… they're not doing that aspect of it.

324
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:21.389
LP1: I'm sorry to go on, but I've got a couple of other things to say.

325
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.940
Jerry Michalski: Can you tell us what… can you tell us what grade you teach, just so I can…

326
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:32.850
LP1: I teach… I don't know what… I don't know what the French grades are. Just let me tell you, I teach from… I teach 11-year-olds through to 17-year-olds.

327
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:33.820
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, please continue.

328
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:52.900
LP1: I was, we've been talking about the curiosity in social situations as well. I have a very poor memory for vocabulary. I have to be immersed in a vocabulary for quite a long time. I'm probably dyslexic, but too old to have had any, certification.

329
00:40:53.370 --> 00:41:17.960
LP1: I dread talking to people and trying to be curious about them, because I won't remember the details, and the worst thing that can happen to me is I meet them again, so if I meet any of you again, I can't remember the name, I can't remember where they live, they've told me all these things about them, and for that sort of detail, my head is a sieve. So I think there are all sorts of things, if you're talking about curiosity in social situations, you've got your culture, you've got your upbringing.

330
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:24.200
LP1: And you've got your confidence in, you know, maintaining those, relationships,

331
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:30.110
LP1: over… over a period of time. So, maybe that's enough from me. Thank you.

332
00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:36.289
Jerry Michalski: That's delightful. Luis, thank you for joining us. You reminded me that sitting behind me is my dad's old slide rule.

333
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.140
Jerry Michalski: And, that I once…

334
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:52.159
Jerry Michalski: Many, many, many years ago in my youth, knew how to run it, and understood, because my dad had sort of approached it that way, that the slide rule is a fantastic way to estimate things, that engineers were able to just quickly ballpark things.

335
00:41:52.160 --> 00:42:05.000
Jerry Michalski: To do the… is it Fermi? One of the physicists was, Feynman, Fermi, one of those, who was really good at, sort of, quick estimations of large-scale things, so we're kind of losing that as well.

336
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:18.139
LP1: Young students can't do mental arithmetic, they just don't understand, and they think I'm a genius because I can do mental arithmetic on the board while I'm solving problems. I mean, they're in.

337
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.489
Jerry Michalski: The movie Idiocracy?

338
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.080
LP1: I haven't, I'll look it out.

339
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.709
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Just so I… Yeah, it's Eric.

340
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:41.730
Jerry Michalski: it's, alas, a little bit too topical for what we're talking about. It's, you know, in the future, one guy wakes up from a cryogen… an accidental cryogenic sleep, and suddenly it turns out he's the smartest human in the country, so they make him president, because he's the only one who knows, like, the most primitive things. It's a dark comedy, but,

341
00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.090
Jerry Michalski: Right. You'll unfortunately probably enjoy it because of your setting.

342
00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:47.739
Jerry Michalski: Doug, please.

343
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:58.900
Doug Breitbart: Yeah, I, I… I can't help but sort of…

344
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.739
Doug Breitbart: Feel that the question is sort of a straw man.

345
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.579
Doug Breitbart: Because it's… it's… am I…

346
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:15.660
Doug Breitbart: Judging somebody else not being curious enough is what's really being put on the table.

347
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:27.899
Doug Breitbart: And… And the underlying… the underlying active ingredient To me, is connection.

348
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:36.600
Doug Breitbart: And if somebody is… is… if I'm not in connection with the person I'm talking to.

349
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:50.670
Doug Breitbart: Then there's, there's, there's really no way to, to, to engage.

350
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.120
Doug Breitbart: And my experience with…

351
00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:07.790
Doug Breitbart: my experience with younger folk is sort of… is a little bit bivalent. My son, who's around 30, is…

352
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.610
Doug Breitbart: you know, in some…

353
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:20.640
Doug Breitbart: undiagnosed way because he defied all testing. He's, you know, neurodivergent, and he falls into that category of hypersocial.

354
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.110
Doug Breitbart: Like, the quintessential salesman.

355
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:33.039
Doug Breitbart: And… he's endlessly curious. He is always either asking questions or Or, you know, going into…

356
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:44.779
Doug Breitbart: gymnastics. And, you know, has Ulysses-like status in the company he works in, because people have seen him repairing his own flat tires.

357
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:50.320
Doug Breitbart: Which captures this last point that was just made, that, you know, like.

358
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:58.620
Doug Breitbart: He learned how to do that, and somebody, you know, his peers think that's insanely amazing, that he knows how to do that.

359
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:11.800
Doug Breitbart: And… Conversely, there's a rationality to younger people

360
00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:18.500
Doug Breitbart: Being disconnected because of the insanity of the educational system they're subjected to.

361
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.049
Doug Breitbart: And the difference is that…

362
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.690
Jerry Michalski: Certainly, this could be a rational response to a really crappy system they're embedding.

363
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:36.800
Doug Breitbart: To a really insane world that they're staring at and going, what am I, you know, what am I supposed to do with this? How am I supposed to respond to this? And I do think there is a…

364
00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:45.850
Doug Breitbart: You know, as much as they may not have basic underlying skills that we have because we're creatures of the, you know.

365
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.910
Doug Breitbart: 20th century.

366
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:54.289
Doug Breitbart: that, they do have a clarity and awareness.

367
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:58.599
Doug Breitbart: Of their world and their position in it. And… and…

368
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:03.840
Doug Breitbart: There's a certain level of agency and empowerment

369
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:20.830
Doug Breitbart: That also came with the fact that, you know, they get what they want when they want it, what they're not interested in, they're not interested in, what they are interested in, they are interested in, everything's immediate gratification, and they are the kings and queens of their own domain via their screens.

370
00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:21.660
Jerry Michalski: Hmm.

371
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:26.269
Doug Breitbart: And they're… so their whole orientation and experience of the world

372
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:32.659
Doug Breitbart: Is a completely different, like, you know, stranger in a strange land compared to my orientation.

373
00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.089
Doug Breitbart: So it's a different world, and…

374
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:43.759
Doug Breitbart: My curiosity in that is to try to get to their understanding and perspective.

375
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.430
Doug Breitbart: An experience of it.

376
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.210
Doug Breitbart: And wanting to know that, wanting to understand that.

377
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.490
Doug Breitbart: From the inside out, not from the outside looking at.

378
00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.049
Doug Breitbart: So I just wanted to toss that into the mix.

379
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.990
Jerry Michalski: Doug, thank you for layering in a bunch of really interesting other perspectives on the question. I mean, the…

380
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.080
Jerry Michalski: You've got me thinking, is curiosity a superficial trait?

381
00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:18.610
Jerry Michalski: And connection is the thing we seek. And, you know, in that sense, do we need to be talking and inquiring and inquisitive in order to connect?

382
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:24.430
Jerry Michalski: And I don't think… I think the answer is, no, we don't. We can actually connect without those things.

383
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:26.700
Jerry Michalski: Sometimes really deeply.

384
00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.690
Jerry Michalski: There's all kinds of interesting questions on the table. Judy?

385
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.370
Judith Benham: 5?

386
00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.060
Judith Benham: I need to… I need to unmute.

387
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.250
Jerry Michalski: No, you're already unmuted.

388
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.000
Judith Benham: Okay,

389
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:54.720
Judith Benham: I think it's a really complicated topic, in the sense that there's intrinsic and extrinsic curiosity, and it can be enabled or made less popular by circumstantial situations, so

390
00:47:54.970 --> 00:48:13.619
Judith Benham: we might want to scope this out more broadly, because I think there's a lot of intrinsic curiosity, but it can be stifled very easily if people are put down for asking questions or such. And I know I was a hugely curious kid, and so I did get suppressive comments at times.

391
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:30.700
Judith Benham: Fortunately, I got reinforcing behaviors from my family structure, so I persisted. But I think that this is a really important topic, because it's not just curiosity per se, it's acquisition of knowledge and the process of gaining perspective

392
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:45.389
Judith Benham: from examining the full scope and breadth of a topic, and I think that's a bigger question for me in the educational system right now, because I don't think we're encouraging that type of in-depth consideration of

393
00:48:46.370 --> 00:49:04.250
Judith Benham: opposite points of view, for instance. If you think A, well, what is the opposite of A position? What are all the positions in between? How do you sort that out to find what seems to be the best? And that's different than, sort of, intrinsic curiosity, which I think small children have, but it can be stifled.

394
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.620
Judith Benham: I'll just stop there.

395
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:16.519
Jerry Michalski: And you were fortunate to grow up in an environment, in a family, that sort of counteracted other stimuli, which is great.

396
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:18.570
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Judy.

397
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.600
Jerry Michalski: Close.

398
00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:28.079
Klaus Mager: Yeah, I think we are talking about different types of curiosity, so there's this interpersonal curiosity.

399
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:45.369
Klaus Mager: Which is really very cultural. When… when the… I worked for Disney for 21 years, and when we moved to the Hong Kong project, we got set up with a relocation service, and they started us out with a book called Culture Shock Hong Kong.

400
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:55.010
Klaus Mager: And, gave us, you know, an in-depth, briefing on what to say and not to say to people.

401
00:49:55.030 --> 00:50:08.030
Klaus Mager: Then I went to Germany from there after 21 years with Disney, and worked for a very large German corporation, Metro, in the, in the corporate office.

402
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:26.239
Klaus Mager: I was just shocked what people would ask me, you know? I mean… I mean, it was just… it was just so off the wall from an American perspective. Very personal questions that, if you ask that an American, you would be considered wooed, you know?

403
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:33.069
Klaus Mager: So, so there is this interpersonal, which is very cultural, and then we operated in 30 countries.

404
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:51.789
Klaus Mager: So, I mean, I would have… I would go to India, to China, to Russia, Romania, Italy, Spain, right? And it's really very unique how people have basic expectations about what you should be curious about and where the lines are.

405
00:50:51.830 --> 00:51:04.079
Klaus Mager: But then there's this other curiosity about your world, your profession, the world around you, you know, the society you live in, the political life.

406
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:11.069
Klaus Mager: And to want to have a better understanding of that. And I think the information

407
00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:18.750
Klaus Mager: We have available today is so amazingly more, you know, than there ever was.

408
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:33.820
Klaus Mager: Because of social media and because of the access to the internet and all of that. And it's probably overwhelming, you know, for, particularly younger people who haven't found

409
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:44.649
Klaus Mager: a foundation yet to… to know themselves more, yeah? And… and to… to be more secure in… in their own… in their own being.

410
00:51:46.410 --> 00:52:02.379
Klaus Mager: So I don't know if we can randomly say that curiosity is less than what it used to be, because the world has just… the world around us has just changed so much, you know, and the information is so focused, and so concentrated, and so available.

411
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:09.709
Klaus Mager: That, I don't think we can even begin to compare ourselves to someone who lived 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago.

412
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:10.840
Jerry Michalski: Yeah.

413
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:26.740
Jerry Michalski: Doug was starting that piece of the conversation about maybe kids today are growing up in such a dramatically different world, and we're trying to apply archaic ideas about curiosity to a completely different environment. That's an interesting take.

414
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.420
Jerry Michalski: Eve, please.

415
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:29.450
Jerry Michalski: Dang.

416
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:36.140
Eve Blossom: Hey, wonderful to see everyone here. Well, if you'll…

417
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.870
Eve Blossom: Be so kind to let me share,

418
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:43.260
Eve Blossom: and integrate something else I've been thinking about.

419
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:56.560
Eve Blossom: Another angle to curiosity, and thinking about the world as it's reshaped by loss of norms and migration and digital life and climate shifts, our sense of place

420
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:12.349
Eve Blossom: is, more about the connections and meanings we choose. So curiosity intersects with this sense of place, my background is architecture, that keeps our sense of place alive rather than static, and

421
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:20.920
Eve Blossom: One where we continually rediscover what grounds us and challenges us and expands our sense of who we are in relation to the world.

422
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:33.040
Eve Blossom: So, for many, maybe 15 to 25 year olds, maybe the sense of place is shaped as much by their digital communities and global influences as by their immediate surroundings, and…

423
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:37.560
Eve Blossom: It's so different than how we all grew up, like, in the 70s, when I grew up.

424
00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:52.570
Eve Blossom: Living somatically, going to the creek, looking at the tadpoles, you know, learning about things, by hiking or walking and, living in our bodies, in our own physical contexts.

425
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:58.160
Eve Blossom: So I just think it's so different. Anyway, I just want to bring up this sense of place.

426
00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.220
Jerry Michalski: Hmm.

427
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.420
Jerry Michalski: Thank you very much.

428
00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:03.830
Jerry Michalski: Gil.

429
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:14.610
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, I've been… I've been listening to that very thing, Eve, context, throughout this whole conversation. Context and norms.

430
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:25.549
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Is what's been echoing me throughout this. And, and I'm hearing Ken Homer, who's not here yet, with this question, his ever-present question about who's we.

431
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:28.679
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And the corollary question of who's they?

432
00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:42.590
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: which has been throughout this whole conversation, where, you know, there's a whole we and they thing going on here, and it's very not specific. And it's very relevant, because we're talking about conversations with people who are other in some sort of way.

433
00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:55.670
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, different gender, different generation, different geography, different life experience, different schooling, different roles, and so forth. So it's something about, our expectations across those differences.

434
00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:00.950
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And the acculturation, the norms, I've… I…

435
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:03.969
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Pride and Prejudice has been rolling in my mind.

436
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:05.959
Jerry Michalski: As we're talking here.

437
00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:16.849
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, where there was a richly nurtured culture of propriety and manners and how to speak and how not to speak.

438
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:34.510
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And it's different across different classes, not just between the lords and the servants, but between the landowners and the middle class and the tradespeople in town. There are very different patterns of relationship and speech and expectation and what could be asked for. And LP1, I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

439
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:36.360
Jerry Michalski: Louise.

440
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.490
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Louise. Yeah, hi, Louise.

441
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.460
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, you talked about how the French are very direct.

442
00:55:43.920 --> 00:56:00.950
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But the French are different in different parts of France, as the Americans are very different in different parts of the United States. Trust me, I grew up in New York and I live in the Bay Area. You know, really different standards and practices about what you talk about and what you don't, and what you can ask about and what you can't. So… so…

443
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:12.899
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: All of which is to say that the we who is raising the question in this conversation, and the they who we are talking about, is a very important and unstated part of this conversation.

444
00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:19.540
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Gil. If you want to… if you want to brief…

445
00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.279
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Very fluid.

446
00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.440
Jerry Michalski: If you want to deepen your own perceptions of the we's and theys, please feel free, because…

447
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.039
Jerry Michalski: As always, the elaboration helps us.

448
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.069
Jerry Michalski: Kevin, please.

449
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:49.959
Kevin Jones: Yeah, you know, Gil's comment is actually really right on to where I was going. I worked with a friend with the Eastern Band Cherokee, and we were working on a new product development for them that would diversify their income past casinos.

450
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:56.900
Kevin Jones: And, we created a thing with them for the Taste of Cherokee, and they had some

451
00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:03.230
Kevin Jones: Vegetables that were… had been cultivated, that had been domesticated, that they could brand.

452
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:13.340
Kevin Jones: And, but the question that they came back with, and they took forever, because tribes do, they realized that they did not want to make food

453
00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:30.259
Kevin Jones: and it was the Taste of Cherokee, right? That was the thing. They said they didn't want to be… make food a commodity. It should be something where if someone is hungry, and they come to your door, you feed them. They said that, you know, on the other hand, the Choctaw and the Chickasaw would have done it. They're more transactional tribes.

454
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:45.250
Kevin Jones: But the question that the Cherokee always ask, especially when you're dealing with the Cotua band of Cherokee, which are the more traditional and creative, is what does this decision make us in the world

455
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:50.930
Kevin Jones: under the standpoint of reciprocity. And it's like, oh, this turns

456
00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:57.359
Kevin Jones: Feeding people into a commodity thing, and we sell it, and, you know, they sell their crops. They're…

457
00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:05.409
Kevin Jones: double weed baskets can sell for a couple thousand dollars, because they're… they can hold water, they're amazing. But…

458
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:14.379
Kevin Jones: I haven't seen other groups say, what does this decision make us? Because, you know, this was going to do a lot for them. You know, they…

459
00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:19.330
Kevin Jones: Have casino revenue, and they don't have a lot of other revenue, and

460
00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:26.209
Kevin Jones: But they turned down the chance to make… to have a really popular brand in western North Carolina.

461
00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.400
Kevin Jones: Because it…

462
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:46.310
Kevin Jones: it would make them something that they don't want to be. But it takes a tribe in a circle a long time to make that decision, and so when you're dealing with them, you know, the fastest way to get things done and work with a tribe is to have all the time in the world. And so we had posters made up, we had labels, and they just threw them away.

463
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.060
Kevin Jones: I mean, it was their dollar, but it was,

464
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:54.440
Kevin Jones: So that's… that's an interesting question, and I don't… I don't see white folks asking that question much.

465
00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.459
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Kevin, thank you.

466
00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:02.160
Jerry Michalski: for the story. It seems like they went… they went deep into their culture.

467
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:08.850
Jerry Michalski: And thought about what were the influences or effects of… on their culture of this kind of decision, where we have…

468
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:11.989
Kevin Jones: Been born into and have assumed away a normal…

469
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.160
Jerry Michalski: A transactional environment.
