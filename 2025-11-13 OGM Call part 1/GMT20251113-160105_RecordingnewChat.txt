Good question, Scott!

It's a bit of a participatory game that is best played by both participants; it's okay to answer by redirecting to a different topic rather than one you don't want to talk about.

navigating that social practice may be something that people have to be helped to learn, but it's pretty easy to learn.

I totally agree. It’s been the most fascinating value I’ve gotten from my Playing Games model.

My working theory is 1) there is a set of things that all games have, 2) that every interaction with another person is a game, and 3) therefore every interaction has these things. 

So far, I've come up with five elements of a game:  Goal (purpose, point, reason for interacting), Rules (what's allowed or not, whether stated, implied, or customary), Voluntary (invitation AND acceptance, constantly renegotiated), Uncertain (can't know the outcome for sure), and Improve (requires some skill).

this is a curated answer by me and AI:

Japanese culture values 探求心 (tankyūshina, focused desire to discover and understand deeply, rooted in long traditions of scholarship and the shokunin spirit, where traits like 精進 (shōjin, diligent effort), 向学心 (kōgakushin, desire to learn), and 好奇心 (kōkishin, curiosity) are admired.
At the same time, this curiosity is expected to coexist with 謙虚 (kenkyo, humility), 和 (wa, social harmony), and 配慮 (hairyo, consideration for others), shaping it into a quieter, more situationally aware form of inquiry.
For Americans accustomed to openly expressing personal curiosity, these values function as social cues that curiosity should be pursued in ways that avoid disruption, preserve group cohesion, and show respect for shared space.

This is so interesting! Thank you fort this share! I came in this conversation because I am attending an online workshop on Visual thinking (where I met Victoria) and we had a 1h q&a session with the teacher and I felt mixed: I was eager to know something new (since we can ask him anything) but on the other hand I was tense because "I don't know wha to ask (first)", I have some trails but they were so vague. So I apreciate there is a tool to delve deeper to learn how to come around with question "good" to ask.This open for me the point: why that anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom?
