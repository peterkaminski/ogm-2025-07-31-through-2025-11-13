00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is the Open Global Mind weekly call on Thursday, November 13th, 2025.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We have a fun topic today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Which is, what happened to curiosity?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I think I have a funny feeling that many of us have

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
our own theories about this, our own hypotheses.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Uh, so I'm interested, maybe, in collecting up a couple of those before we go in.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Victoria has put a link in the chat, which we may need to put in a couple times, because as people come into the room, they don't see the previous chat.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So we'll probably have to repeat it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But Victoria went to town on an Excalibra board,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that is multi-user, so everybody can go look at it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Uh, maybe a thing I can do…

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Actually, definitely a thing I can do is screen share mine.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
my screen so that everybody can see it on mine for a moment.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Uh, so here is…

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The Excala draw board, I see that several people are already in it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And, uh, you can scroll around…

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And this looks way more interesting and elaborate than when it started.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Which was, I guess, yesterday morning.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Fabulous, love this work.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And, uh, I think everybody can go ahead and add things.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I believe, and Victoria, if you want to do a tutorial, let me know, and you can take over, but just for the moment,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If you wanted to add a box with some comments,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
See the little menu at the top? Click on the rectangle.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And then, uh, basically make a box.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And start typing in it, and give it a color. Over here is the color selection if you want to, to sort of fit the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
mood and method of this whole thing.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm gonna eliminate, I'm gonna try to…

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Delete my box, there we go.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And it's pretty straightforward, and the settings right now are so that lines look like they're a little hand-drawn, and the text

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is a nice handwritten sort of text, which gives the whole…

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Excalibra board, a nice feeling of, of sort of human…

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
humanity and, uh…

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Looks like it was created by people drawing on a board, which is very, very nice.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And then…

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And just to make everyone comfortable, I have a copy of this State of the Board.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So, if everything is messed…

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Excellent.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It doesn't matter.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Beautiful. So Victoria has taken a snapshot, and we're off to the races. So, riff on this, add to it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
do whatever. Victoria, anything you want to add to what I just described?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Well, my only…

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
remark is what it's at the top left corner.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Because…

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in that… in…

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in the mail, we were given many solutions.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And closing very early the problem.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And that's not what we should strive for. We should strive for open as many questions as possible. So if instead of saying,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Uh, education, closest curiosity. We state it as a question.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Does education close up?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Then we will have more things to work with.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Sounds great. I tend to think of it as just depositing of multiple theories instead of the choosing of one to close it down.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yes, well, the thing is…

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Gathering all the opinions, but trying…

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to show that we are not closing, but opening.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Yep. Perfect.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Sounds great. Um…

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Thank you, thank you. So, with that, I'll stop my screen share and hope that everybody can follow the links

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And get, uh, into the Excalibra.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And see if anybody wants to take an opening step, or… Victoria, if you want to take an opening step into the conversation, that would be great, too.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, for me, as you have seen, it's, um…

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
like, an ongoing theme?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Like, when I first talked to you, Jerry, and you said that trust…

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And consumerism were your things.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So, the other day, I understood that this also has been always a concern for me.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And seeing how it exploded in the community,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I thought, okay, instead of…

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Each of us, like…

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Taking it to one place or another?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
why don't we get everything inside, so we can maybe decide

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We can work, because here today I have the issue of access.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
that links with…

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
the fact that you say,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Uh, books are, like, fossil knowledge.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It's trapped, there are also the silos.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the academia…

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that you need subscriptions, paid subscriptions, to…

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So, there are a lot of things going on, so maybe…

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We must, like, gather everything,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And I start thinking how this relates to different OGM projects.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Or maybe different things that can start from here.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So the… my…

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I wanted to link this issue with the other issues that are going around in the community.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Brilliant. Thank you, that's great.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I love that. Um…

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Kevin, please.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Is the premise that we are losing, or curiosity is being diminished?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Uh, if that's it, I completely disagree, so I'm curious.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I think… I think the question started as, hey,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
kids in school seem incurious.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
things like that are happening, like, are we losing curiosity? And I think in general,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
will agree with you that, no, no, no. And in particular, we have a selection bias problem here.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Which is that I think everybody in this room is, like, really, really curious and probably hangs out with really curious people.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Um, but, uh, Victoria, I don't know if you want to address that, or anybody else.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I'll say something on it. Oh, Scott, sorry, you were ahead of me.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Oh, I guess I hit my buzzer faster than you.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Yeah.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Um, what… what struck me as interesting in this, I agree with you, Jerry, that we have a

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
a bias of the people in the room, because this room attracts those kinds of people. And my art…

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
argument would be that this group tends to be high in openness.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So if we look at the Big Five personality model, which is the…

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
was statistically verified model of personality.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Openness is one of the five dimensions.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And that dimension…

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is… people who tend to be creative, interested in intellectual pursuits,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
open to new things and new ways, curious.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And it exists on a spectrum.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There are people who are low in openness.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And neither end of the spectrum

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
is, um…

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
evolutionarily better, which is why we have…

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the spectrum. Sometimes you need to be less open.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And you need to be more…

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
literal, or more practical, or more…

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
tradition, or history, or ritual.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And sometimes you need to be more open,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And more accepting and more combining, and more…

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
far-reaching, and that sort of thing, which is why

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
My understanding of it is why we have both ends. But my thought is, is that…

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
If we're looking for people who are… or if we're seeing things where evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000
notice all of those instances where people are less curious, and I think those are the people who are

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
less on the open side, and…

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that I, um, I tend to agree that it's not…

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I haven't seen a sea change in that, but that was one thing I wanted to put out there, is that I believe it exists on a…

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Thanks, Scott.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Gil, please.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Yeah. Yeah, I've raised this a couple of times out of personal experience, um, which may have all kinds of selection bias in it. I've observed

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The initial assessment that I formed was that… was that people much younger than me were not curious, and how that showed up is conversations with them.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Where I would ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Which I found perplexing. And I found this even more striking in networking situations, where you're meeting somebody at a conference and you're chatting, and I've been really struck at how one way those conversations have been.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Um, and so I've taken recently to, um,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
doing something I've never done before, just like start to talk about things in the course of meeting someone new.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I'll start to talk about what I'm up to, what I'm doing, what I want to talk about, what I would have wanted to be asked about.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And then the conversation proceeds kind of normally. They're interested, and there's back and forth, but the initiation, what I'm calling curiosity of asking questions about somebody else,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
what they're thinking, interested in, doing, or so forth.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I'm noticing it in its absence.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But to qualify what I just said,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I was remembering last night, we… Jane and I had dinner.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
A few months ago, uh, with a person who we've known since she was, like, 12.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Um, but she's now 55, or something like that.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And, um, she made us a lovely buffet. We had spent the afternoon in her backyard.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I spent about… spent about 3 hours together.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Um, and she didn't ask a single question.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Of us. How we doing? How's your life, how's your health? She knows that Jane has been going through major health issues for many years.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to somebody who knows her and loves her.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And… didn't ask anything.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I was really… I was… I became increasingly uncomfortable. I was really baffled. I didn't figure out what was…

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
what was weird until afterwards,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But I've never been in a situation like that.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So, that… it echoes the question about curiosity. It challenges my assumption that it's a phenomenon of younger people, because

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
She's, you know, not younger, she's younger than us, but she's not young.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So, um, um, and one… let me throw one more data point into this, which is an old one. So, early on in natural logic, we were doing lots of site assessments of companies, looking, you know, looking at efficiency.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Uh, and footprint reduction opportunities.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And, um…

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Uh, one of my junior staff members, who's actually not so junior, like, you know, an engineer, smart,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Um, analytical, had been with me on a number of these,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
he finally went out on one of his own.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And when he came back, I was really struck at how… at all kinds of information that he hadn't gathered.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Um, and we kind of unpacked what he talked with the staff at the company about, and…

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I would say, like, did you ask him about ABC? He said, God, I didn't think of that.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So, this is maybe not curiosity, but it's a… the map of distinctions that leads somebody on a trail of investigation.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Uh, it was very striking how different his…

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But I called Curiosity was. And how we had to kind of, you know, train him up.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And being curious, investigating…

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Um, let me stop there. There's more to say, but I want to not hog the mic here.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I'll stop there.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Gil, I'm really appreciating your first-person stories. I really like that, you know, this person is doing this because I'm…

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I'm coming into this partly from having read a few too many stories about how incurious

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Recent graduates seem to be, when they come into work, which leads us into the education conversation. Is something happening to our kids who are busy?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Cramming but not learning.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Have we stamped out, sort of, inquisitiveness in the schooling system? And that… and we'll go there.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But I think there's lots of other things going on.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that your stories are pointing to. Go ahead.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And let me just say one other thing before I yield it to Alex. I put a note in the chat. I'm an etymology geek, so I started quickly looking for etymology and found this thing saying, well, there's this curious etymology.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Um, uh, curious etymology, curiosity relates to care.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Kura. And so in this formulation, they're saying its origins reveal a deeper truth. To be curious as to care enough.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.000
To pay attention. So that may be a false trail, or that may be a relevant piece of this conversation, I don't know.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
That's lovely. I think that the etymology is important as well.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Thanks.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And Victoria, thank you, I stuck that into the drawing.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Beautiful, yep. I saw that you did that.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Maybe not skillfully, but there it is.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Excellent. Uh, Alex, please.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Thanks. Um, I suddenly realized I didn't have it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So, the points have been made so far are very, sort of, not very, they're on the academic side of curiosity.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
My… I thought when we first mentioned it, we'd start talking about.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The curiosity, in the sense that we're so polarized that each side, or whoever it is.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And I can go through the recordings, and I can find every single… sorry, not every single… at least one example where each one of you.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
has made a statement, and I'm thinking. But why don't you look at it from this point of view?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And it'll disprove your statement, okay? Every single one of you, I'm sure, I'll come up with.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
It's inherent in us. We want to feel good.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So, so it depends on the topic. So if it's politics, and we're on the left or the right.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
we don't want to… challenge our mental model and belief system.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So that's one of the obstacles to being curious.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And it really puzzles me because. And many people have said this in the Twitter sphere, whatever.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
whatever it is, that it's really amazing that we as humans.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
We'll go to page 1, and we'll read about some politician announcing a new this, that, and the other.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and say how great the politician is, if we support them.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And then we'll go to number 5, you know, page 5 of the newspaper.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And there's an article of what Shai says that politicians are.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And we can compartmentalize the two and not. cross-feed if he's the shyster over there, if that part is lying over there.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:24.000
what tells you that they tell the truth here? And that, to me, it's curiosity, or… maybe I'm using the wrong word, which amazes me, because I do it, and I'm sure everybody else does it.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And yet, we know it. You know, it's sort of, um… the other thing was about the young. I have personal experience from my kids.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I… what can I say? I enjoy talking.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000
discussing things with them. if there's no belief system involved, be it politics, religion, whatever it is.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We have a great conversation. But as soon as we start discussing things we care about.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And remember, the mechanic here is, oh. that's an old what's it, so he's not going to think about it the way as us.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:08.000
But what amazes me is their reluctance. To even hear or question what their belief system… something I might challenge the belief system. It really is amazing, and I do think, Jerry, you mentioned it.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
It's to do with, um, the way we've been taught, and it isn't something that's just happened.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I think it's happened over time that we kind of.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Maybe it's the influence of TV, because it's an acceptance machine, and on TV, you don't actually challenge anything, you just.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
watch and enjoy. You don't interact with it or something like that, maybe radio as well.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000
maybe how the technology has grown, but. young people, I think it's a teaching system, or the teach… they don't… they're not… the Fed information.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And I always used to think… I always used to think I was challenged at school to think differently.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:53.000
But maybe I wasn't, I don't know. But that was the, um… That was the point I wanted to say, is that we're all doing this.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
every day, even in this call, we will do it.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:08.000
That we're not… you guys call it curiosity, I call it… the not standard, or what you see in front of your point of view.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
That was me. Have you considered yourself all told off?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Oh, totally.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
For not being perfect human.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Totally, Alex, thank you. I'm thinking, at first, I am noticing that my image is flashing green every now and then. I think it's my little USB hub, which is…

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Not happy that I've got the microphone plugged in as well as the camera through it, so I'm gonna troubleshoot that, but in case you're like, what's going on with Jerry? It's not that I'm coming, phoning in from a different planet, it's that some of my…

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Systems are not cooperating properly.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Um, Alex, I think a piece of what you were pointing to, uh, I would… I would have called critical thinking,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And I'm also realizing that we could have replaced the word curiosity with the phrase critical thinking in the invite to today's call, and probably would have gotten a similar showing.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Maybe that's a topic for future… it's adjacent, as Gil says, you know, right after.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
right after my thing. Uh, Scott's unsure.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
But…

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
there's a piece of what I think you're raising, Alex, which is about our identity and our self-image.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And our cell… the preservation of self.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
or the… or even… or even…

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
the development of self, and how… what we… who we think we are and where we think we stand.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And I think there's an interesting bit of conversation here about

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Are we now afraid to take a stand? Are we confused about where the stands are? Do we think that taking a stand has become

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Dangerous, uh, because of the level of… the poor level of discourse out there in the public arena.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Are we afraid of being canceled, or afraid of being pounded, or trolled, or whatever else? And those all seem, you know, more or less legitimate.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
In the current environment.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Let me go to Pete. And Alex, if you'll take your hand down from…

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Before. Pete, please.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Uh, thank you, Sherry. And, uh, Alex, thanks for telling us all off. I appreciate it.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Um…

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Uh, I… I guess I wanted to say that I don't…

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I see declines in curiosity, but I think I also see increases in curiosity, too.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:23.000
So, I think it… it changes the landscape. It keeps changing. Um, I certainly know there are places where we kill curiosity.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
living in an entertainment culture where you're supposed to sit back and

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
consume, but not, uh, participate.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
is obviously a bad thing. Um, the way that we do education, uh,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I, you know, as a kid growing up in school, there were lots of ways

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Teachers killed Mike, uh, curiosity, um, and…

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
and worse for other people in my classes.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Um, I wanted to… the reason I raised my hand and wanted to say something was because of Gil's story about the person that he and Jane know.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
that didn't ask, uh, didn't ask

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
you know, about them. And it reminds me, I learned from Joanne, my wife, uh,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
to be able to have

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
to be able to be curious and have a conversation with somebody, even if…

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Maybe you don't care in the grander scheme of things, or you're shy, or whatever.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I'm… I'm kind of shy.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Um, and it's just a rote thing, right? Um, it's just human and polite, uh, to be sitting with somebody and to ask them, you know?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:50.000
you know, how's your life? Uh, do you have pets? Uh, do you have friends? Uh, you know, where did you grow up? Those kinds of things. It's not hard to do. And…

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I know I went from somebody who

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
didn't have that as a skill that I was ever taught, really, by my parents, or my peers, or my school.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Um, uh, I learned that very quickly from Joanne.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Um, and so…

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:15.000
one of, uh, certainly some curiosity is innate. I've got a lot of innate curiosity, and probably most of the people in this… in this room do.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
The place where I see that most nowadays is actually, um, working with AI, um,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I've spent a lot of time showing people how, you know, this AI thing.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And there are a lot of people who…

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Um, they play with it for a little bit, and it doesn't do anything interesting, and then they're done. And, you know, I'm like, well, I'm… I… when I tried playing with it, it was actually hard work, I remember.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Having to sit down and go, okay, what can I do with it now? What crazy thing could I give it, you know?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:58.000
you know, I used to do things like write poetry in 3 different languages, come up with a short story that starts with blah, come up with, you know, all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Um, and it was not second nature to do that with this new…

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
information tool. It was something I had to work through, but…

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
I was so curious about it, I worked through it. And I see a lot of people bouncing off new technology, um, because of that.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Same thing, you know, when people adopted the internet. Same thing when people adopted PCs.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:32.000
You know, I was an early adopter of those, and I was like, you know, I don't know what it does, but let me find out, let me try to break it, let me try to do crazy stuff with it, can it do this, can it do that?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Um, so…

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Some… some is definitely innate. Some curiosity is definitely innate, but another thing…

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
that Gil's story made me realize, is some curiosity is a social practice.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Um, you know, I…

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
somewhere in our world, it ought to be

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And end up that you get taught by your peers, or your school, or your parents, or somebody.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
You know, here's some things that you can do to…

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
enact curiosity, even if you're not particularly interested,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:15.000
just enact it as a social practice because it helps everybody. You know, it helps, um, it helps people feel good when you talk about them. It helps people…

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
It helps you learn stuff that you wouldn't have known otherwise when you're, you know, got

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
We've got a few hours, uh, writing in a carriage, or…

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Um, in an airplane, or whatever we do nowadays.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Um, so that was what I wanted to say. Thanks.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Thanks, Pete.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Stacy.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Thanks, Peter. I have to address what you said first, or maybe second.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Yeah, I'll do… I'll do that after. Um, or maybe… you maybe have to get that out of the way first.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.000
I'm just on the other side of, um… Yeah, curiosity when it's not genuine.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000
can also be really annoying. It's, it's like… Yeah, let me just get that off my chest.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Because it… at least for… Me…

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I don't know if it's… if I want to say as a woman or not.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
As someone who sometimes feels or has felt disempowered.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Sometimes curiosity. can feel like I have to explain myself.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
So I just want to put that out there.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
It feels like prying.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
And…

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
It feels like prying, you mean, or…?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:50.000
genuinely. Say it again? Yeah, or, like, having to justify why I'm doing what I'm doing.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Mm-hmm.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And if I may, when I learned

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
this kind of social curiosity from Joanne.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
when it's genuine, it's wonderful. There's nothing…

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Her observation, as a woman, was…

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
men are acculturated to not be curious, especially about women, about lots of stuff, right? And so…

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
in a way, it was a kind of women's work, that she doesn't mind doing because it's not the worst

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
thing that women have to do in this world. Um, but…

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
She was always… she felt like she was always the one who were like, you know, it's not that hard, guys.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Uh, just ask questions. And you're entirely correct. Insincere.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Uh, curiosity is worse than just shutting up. However,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I would also say, um, it's…

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Yeah.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
It's not hard at all to learn to ask humbly and be genuinely interested in the answer.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Thank you.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Where did you grow up? You know, it's not…

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
it's… it's, uh… I can ask that question and not care about the answer, but…

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
It's not hard as a social practice for me to say, I really do care where you grew up.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000
And I hope you ask if… where I grew up, too, but, you know, if you don't, I understand that you're not

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.000
You're not as careful as I am, or you're not as polite, or whatever, I'm gonna, like, shine that on. And I know women have to do that a lot more than men, so…

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Yeah, and you know it, I'm probably the wrong person, because I'm not doing anything I don't want to do.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I'm sorry, anybody. I don't pro- I probably don't care where you live, so somebody else will ask you.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Well, you ask even better questions, Stacy. But, you know, there's a set of, like, 5 questions that even, uh…

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Forgive me, forgive me.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000
A man can learn, you know, ask this question, really care about the answer, and there's probably a follow-up question, you know?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Where did you go to school? You know, it's…

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Okay, anyway, let me, let me, let me say what I really wanted to say.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
pretty simple to do. Go ahead, I'm sorry to have interrupted you.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Now, now I'm curious what you're going to say.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Um… Okay, this is what I want to say. I want to go back to.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I want to connect to where Gil was speaking.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Because I… so I was reminded of, um… George Mombia, where he says.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Where we don't have the story, we make up one, and I want to connect to Gil's stories.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So, when he was speaking about, like, coaching and.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
I was thinking, so the people that don't ask questions then.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
the story that I made up in my mind.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:26.000
is that sometimes people that are either younger. or if I could replace that with less experience, because they might be the same age.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
But they might be less experienced. Sometimes they haven't had the space to talk.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:41.000
And so they don't want to ask questions. And hear experience, because they are just dying to have somebody hear them.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
So I want to throw that out. Um, and as far as the people that were talking to Jane.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Sometimes people are afraid to hear the answers, and they're so uncomfortable.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:04.000
with sickness, and they don't want to know. And I wanted to throw that out, too, because sometimes really caring, loving people.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
are just so uncomfortable with feelings and don't know what to say.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:24.000
And that calls in, you know, the curiosity kind of killed the cat thing, so sometimes we don't ask questions. Well, I'm looking at the lawyer in the corner. Doug, you're in the corner, and it's like, don't ask the question that you don't know the answer to.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
So, um, those are some stories that came, some possible stories.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Um, I tend to be somebody I will ask the question.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Because I don't want to make up a story in my head.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
It's usually, I've found in my life, it's better to ask the question and know for sure.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000
than to just imagine what the answer is. And do I have any other questions… anything? Okay, I think… I think I covered everything I wanted to say.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Yay! Thank you, Stacey.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Over.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
You're reminding me of a conversation I'm having on LinkedIn, where I put a post in about futurists and future visions,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
how they're all kind of crappy, and a friend of mine posted in the comments,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
about, um…

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Maybe we don't need future visions. Maybe what we need is to be really present.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
And it kind of flipped the game on me, and it was really interesting, because I find that…

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:22.000
whatever model I have of where we're going, and the competing models of where we're going, I love that conversation and that battle.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
But I also find that my behavior changes enormously depending on what I think

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
what I think I want in the future. I need those visions in order to figure out what…

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
how to be present.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
And so, I haven't seen her response to that, but we're in the middle of that conversation right now. It's kind of cool.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Mr. Jones, thanks for your patience.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Well, you know, I think my success in life has been based on not paying attention in school.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Because I never could figure out what they wanted, and it didn't seem like much.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:02.000
But then when I got into business, I understood I was in a fluid, dynamic system that people were passionate about, and they were making things and buying things and selling things, and it was my Breyer patch.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And I'm running my friend Ben Santer, and his story, I think, is really relevant.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:15.000
He was a PhD candidate who failed 3 times and was working in day labor in Seattle.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And the one professor who still believed in him got him a gig.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Of copying, uh, maps in an ag weather, uh.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
company. And he suddenly understood climate, and it was a big enough thing, just like school wasn't big enough, climate was.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
He was the author of the first UN report on climate.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And one of the reasons he was the author is he had a really, you know, his ego was really in check, because he remembered he… If he hadn't had that one-day labor come through, he would still be.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:56.000
You know, day laborers don't stay very stable, and so he was the one everybody trusted, and it was only when he… he just saw.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:07.000
You know, a weather map of Kansas. And, you know, what was going to happen to corn, and suddenly understood the system he was in. And, you know, he and I are similar in that way.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Is that, you know, again, not paying attention to school was a great gift.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Um, and… because I found the place where I did fit, you know, it was… Fluid, dynamic system, you know, with elements of reciprocity, and so… Ben was the same way, so I think, you know.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I think you have to survive school, but I don't see people low… you know, it's just they hadn't found the, you know, their briar patch, that's what I think.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Thanks, Kevin. Scott.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
range, and that's the Big Five model kind of supports that.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I don't want to throw a scatterbomb of different

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
ideas, so I'm looking for a theme here.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Excellent.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Um, alright, this is one I don't…

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
No.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
I like this idea that Pete had brought up about

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
asking people. I do it all the time.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
I talked to the people at the checkout line.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
In the grocery store, and things like that.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Um, I like to think

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
As a 59-year-old, that I'm not that creepy old guy.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
that I'm actually sincere, that I'm actually… we have a pleasant exchange, that I know a little something about them,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
what they're like, and it's… it's…

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
It's better than a simply pure transactional.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
I'm wondering, and this is the part that I don't know, is…

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Are we… are our young people being raised to

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
not do that.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Because…

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
We don't want to discriminate.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
based on any of the discrimination

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
factors that we shouldn't discriminate on, and that

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
We shouldn't be intrusive, as you said, and that the idea of

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
sharing things about yourself.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
is more often, or can be used, especially online,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
For insult, rather than connection.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And we're going to seek to avoid pain more than we are

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
towards pleasure.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And the internet's forever.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
You know, and so online, if you share personal things about yourself,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:32.000
They're… they're generally unneeded for the conversation that you're having, because it's about some other topic, or it's not germane.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
It can be used against you, and maybe you… maybe…

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
That's part of it, personally, and the other part is that maybe we're taught don't…

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Don't ask those things, we are not supposed to…

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
inquire about race and religion and gender and all of those things, because it's…

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
it caused trouble, and…

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
the last thought that I had that was all connected into that was that I…

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Met my wife online.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
And I say often that it was the best thing.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
The best thing, because I had to meet the person.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Before I could meet the person.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
And it stripped away all the… all the other stuff. I just had to…

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I had to get to know this individual.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And it has worked out extremely well because of that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Thanks, Scott. Victoria.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I just wanted to make a real

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
follow up on this conversation about carrying?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
By presenting you all, my friend Gabrielle,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Who has to join us, because this morning we were… we were walking together,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
iron.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
He, in Italy, in Spain, but we were working together.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And I asked… I told him about this session, and since he's young,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
So, this is a different perspective.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
And since he's starting to be a teacher or help

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
people learn. I thought it was…

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
important that we can hear his voice, even if he's not raising the hand.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
That's on.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Victoria, thank you very much, and I was sort of looking for a place to say hi to Gabriele.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And, uh, let him jump in. If you'd like to say anything or just introduce yourself, please feel free right now.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Okay, thank you. It's so curious to be here, um… Uh, just the connection that happens through internet.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:52.000
It's astounding to me. I'm glad to hear your conversation by now. I don't want to jump in because.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I… I… Still trying to put my toes in order.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000
But it's really… Uh… Uh, good things to be here.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
So, thank you for having, uh, opened your door, internet door for me now.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000
That's great, thank you. What city in Italy are you in?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Very cool. Thank you, thank you so much.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I am Padwa, near Venice. Padua.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Um, cool. Uh, LP1, are you Don Bergen or Louise King, or…?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
I'm Louise, hello everyone. Yes.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
You are Louise, okay, you look so much like my friend Don, that's very funny. Thanks for joining us, Louise.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Okay. Um, yes, and I've joined today because I am, um, teaching. I'm teaching in an international section in a French Lise.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Um, and, um, I'm trying to decide whether I am seeing a decline in curiosity and confidence in my classroom.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Or whether it's just I'm getting old. Um, we always hear that from.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:10.000
uh, you know, the previous generation or the young people today, um, they're not curious, they're not whatever.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Um, but I would say that the last couple of years, I have really begun to wonder.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
if it's me or if it's them. Um, some of the things I see is I do see.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Many students lacking in confidence. They're asking some of the most basic things. Can I use color miss? Can I use whiteout?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Should I underline? Should I… and it's like, I have to say to them, you can make those decisions. They aren't… Challenging decisions, they're not important decisions.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:53.000
You can make those for yourself. And I am seeing this anxiety of them, um, you know, making the simplest of moves.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Um, the other one is, um… I really think I've seen a decline in attention.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Um, and, uh, focus and involvement in tasks. Um, I was reflecting on a particular class that I gave an assessment to recently, and I've done the same assessment perhaps for the past 4 or 5 years, and literally, it's the very worst.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
performance I've ever had. So I'm the same teacher in the room.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
And this is a really cool performance across… I know there are lots of factors there.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Um, so that's one of the reasons I'm here. I've… I've got a bit of a thing about technology. I'm a maths teacher.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000
And definitely with the use of calculators, I've seen a great decline in students' mental abilities.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Now, there is the feeling that that doesn't matter, they're using calculators, and as long as they can still think mathematically, it doesn't matter if they're not doing calculations, or they're not graphing, or they're not.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000
But I wonder if it does diminish their mental capacity for understanding if they haven't done it themselves.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000
So now I see them using ChatG… ChatGPT to, um, literally write their essays.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000
We're going to see a decline in the skills of writing, of, um, expressing their ideas, um, in the written word.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Although, again, you could argue, does that matter? We're moving away from the printed word, we're moving back to, um, video, to the spoken word.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
spreading ideas through the spoken word, so is it important if they can no longer.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I should. Okay.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Right. So I'm full of all these, these questions about my situation.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Um, I did… I did have that thought that, because I see this, is curiosity innate, or can we teach it?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.000
I try to teach problem solving. I see some students are just there, they just have ideas, they try them out.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
It doesn't work, they'll try something different, they might be asking questions.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And I see other students who simply are there going, I don't know what to do.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And I have never seen myself, despite I've tried hard, I've tried different methods.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
I've never seen a student learn how to problem solve. They either seem to have it.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Or they don't. Um, they might be really great at lots of other things, so that's brilliant, but they're not… they're not doing that aspect of it.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
I'm sorry to go on, but I've got a couple of other things to say.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Please, can you tell us what… can you tell us what grade you teach, just so I can…

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:32.000
I'm somebody… I take… I don't know what… I don't know what the French grades are, just let me tell you, I teach from… I teach 11-year-olds through to 17-year-olds.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Thank you, please continue.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Um, I was, um, we've been talking about the curiosity and social situations as well. I have a very poor memory.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:53.000
for vocabulary. I have to be immersed in a vocabulary for quite a long time. I'm probably dyslexic, but too old to have had any, um… certification.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I dread talking to people and trying to be curious about them, because I won't remember the details, and the worst thing that can happen to me is I meet them again, so if I meet any of you again.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000
I can't remember the name, I can't remember where they lived. They've told me all these things about them, and for that sort of detail, my head is a sieve.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:24.000
So I think there are all sorts of things if you're talking about curiosity and social situations, you've got your culture, you've got your upbringing, and you've got your confidence in, you know, maintaining those relationships, uh.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Over… over a period of time, so… Um, maybe that's enough from me. Thank you.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000
That's delightful. Luis, thank you for joining us. You reminded me that sitting behind me is my dad's old slide rule.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
And, uh, that I once…

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
many, many, many years ago in my youth knew how to run it, and…

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
and understood, because my dad had sort of approached it that way, that the slide rule is a fantastic way to estimate things, that

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
that engineers were able to just quickly ballpark things.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Uh, to do the… is it Fermi?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
One of the physicists was Feynman, Fermi, one of those,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
who was really good at, sort of, quick estimations of large-scale things, so…

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
We're kind of losing that as well.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Um…

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Young students can't do mental arithmetic, um, they just don't understand.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
And they think I'm a genius because I can do mental arithmetic on the board while I'm solving problems.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Have you seen the movie Idiocracy?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
I mean, they're in all. I haven't, I'll look it out.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Just so I… Aaron.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Yeah, it's, alas, a little bit too topical for what we're talking about.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
You know, in the future, one guy wakes up from a cryogen… an accidental cryogenic sleep, and suddenly it turns out he's the smartest human on the…

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:40.000
in the country, so they make him president, because he only one who knows, like, the most primitive things. It's a dark comedy.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
But, uh, you'll unfortunately probably enjoy it because of your setting.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Um, uh, Doug, please.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Yeah, I, um… I… I can't help it, sort of.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.000
feel the question… It's sort of a straw man.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Because it's… it's… am I… judging somebody else not being curious enough is what's really being.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:26.000
And… And the underlying… the underlying active ingredient.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:43.000
to me is connection. And if somebody is… is… if I'm not in connection with the person I'm talking to.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:52.000
then there's… there's really no way to… to, um… to engage.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:59.000
And my experience with…

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
My experience with younger folk is sort of… is a little bit bivalent.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
My son, who's around 30. is, you know.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
In some undiagnosed way, because he defied all testing, he's.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.000
You know, neurodivergent… And he falls into that category of… hypersocial, like the quintessential salesman.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Um, and… He's endlessly curious. He is always either asking questions or.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Or, you know, going into… Um, gymnastics and.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
You know, as Ulysses-like status in the company he works in, because.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
people have seen him repairing his own flat tires.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Which captures this last point that was just made, that, you know, like.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
He learned how to do that, and somebody… You know, his peers think.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
That's insanely amazing that he knows how to do that.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
And, um… Conversely.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Um… there's a rationality to.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:20.000
younger people. being disconnected because of the insanity of the educational system they're subjected to.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
So, so you're saying, partly this could be a rational response to a really crappy system they're embedded in.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And the difference is that.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Yeah.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
to a really insane world that they're staring at and going, what am I, you know, what am I supposed to do with this?

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:40.000
How am I supposed to respond to this? And I do think there is a… You know, as much as they may not.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
have basic underlying skills that we have because we're.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:54.000
creatures of the, you know. 20th century, um… That, um… They do have a clarity and awareness.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:04.000
of their world and their position in it. And there's a certain level of agency and empowerment.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Um, that also came with the fact that, you know.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:15.000
They get what they want when they want it, what they're not interested in. They're not interested in what they are interested in they are interested in. Everything's immediate gratification, and.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
They're the kings and queens of their own domain.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Hmm.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
via their screens. And they're… so their whole orientation and experience.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.000
of the world. is a completely different, like, you know, stranger in a strange land compared to my orientation.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:44.000
So it's a different world, and. My curiosity… in that is to try to get to their understanding and perspective.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:51.000
an experience of it. Um, and wanting to know that, wanting to understand that.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:00.000
from the inside out, not from the outside looking at.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Doug, thank you for layering in a bunch of really interesting other perspectives on the question. I mean, the…

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
You've got me thinking, is curiosity a superficial trait?

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Uh, and connection is the thing we seek, and, you know, in that sense, do we need to be talking and inquiring and inquisitive in order to connect?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Uh, and I don't think… I think the answer is no, we don't. We can actually connect without those things.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
sometimes really deeply.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
there's all kinds of interesting questions on the table. Judy?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Off to you.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
5. I need to, I need to unmute.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
No, you're already unmuted, we hear you.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Oh, okay, um… I think it's a really complicated topic in the sense that.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
there's intrinsic and extrinsic curiosity, and it can be enabled or.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:07.000
made less popular by circumstantial situations, so… We might want to scope this out more broadly, because I think there's a lot of intrinsic curiosity, but it can be stifled very easily if people are put down for asking questions or such.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:14.000
And I know I was a hugely curious kid, and so I… I did get suppressive comments at times.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Fortunately, I got reinforcing. behaviors from my family structure, so I persisted.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:30.000
But I think that this is a really important topic because it's not just curiosity per se, it's acquisition of knowledge and the process of gaining perspective.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
From examining the full scope and breadth of a topic, and I think.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:42.000
That's a bigger question for me in the educational system right now, because I don't think we're encouraging.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:52.000
that type of in-depth consideration of. opposite points of view, for instance. If you think, A, well, what is the opposite of A position.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:06.000
What are all the positions in between? How do you sort that out to find what seems to be the best? And that's different than sort of intrinsic curiosity, which I think small children have, but it can be stifled.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
I'll just stop there.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Love that. And you were fortunate to grow up in an environment, in a family, that sort of counteracted

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
other stimuli, which is great.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Thanks, Judy. Klaus.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Yeah, I think we are talking about different types of curiosity, so there's this interpersonal curiosity.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Which is really very cultural. I mean… I worked for Disney for 21 years, and then we moved to the Hong Kong project.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:47.000
We got set up with a relocation service, and they started us a lot with a book called Culture Shock Hong Kong.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
And, uh, gave us, you know, an in-depth, uh.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
briefing on what to say and not to say to people.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Um, then I went to Germany from there, after 21 years with Disney.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Um, and worked for a very large German corporation, Metro.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
You know, in the, uh, in the corporate office.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
I was just shocked what people would ask me, you know, I mean.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:20.000
I mean, it was just… it was just so off the wall from an American perspective, very personal questions.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
That, uh, if you offset an American, you would be considered.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Would, you know? So, so there is this interpersonal, which is very cultural, and then we operated in 30 countries.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.000
So, now I would have, uh… I would go to India, to China, to Russia.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Romania, Italy, Spain, right? And it's really very unique how.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:52.000
People have basic expectations about what you should be curious about and where the lines are.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:59.000
But then there's this other curiosity about your world, your profession, just the.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
the world around you, you know, the society you live in, the political life.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And to want to have a better understanding of that.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
And I think the information… we have available today.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
is so amazingly more, you know, than there ever was.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Um, because of social media, and because of the access to.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:34.000
the internet and all of that. Uh, and I… it's probably overwhelming now for, for, uh, particularly younger people who haven't found.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:45.000
a foundation yet to know themselves more, yeah. And to be more secure in their own being.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Um, so I don't know if we can randomly say that curiosity is less than what it used to be, because the world has just… the world around us has just changed so much, you know, and the information is so focused and so concentrated.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:09.000
And so available now. That, uh, I don't think we can even begin to compare ourselves to someone who lived 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Yeah. Um, Doug was starting that piece of the conversation about maybe

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Kids today are growing up in a… such a dramatically different world, and we're trying to apply archaic ideas about curiosity to…

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
a completely different environment. That's a…

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
An interesting take. Eve, please.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Dang.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Hey, um, wonderful to see everyone here.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Um, well, if you'll…

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
be so kind to let me share, uh,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
and integrate something else I've been thinking about.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Um, another angle to curiosity.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Um, and thinking about the world as it's reshaped by loss of norms and migration and digital life and…

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Climate shifts, um, our sense of place,

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000
is, uh, more about the connections and meanings we choose

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Um, so curiosity intersects with this sense of place. My background is architecture,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Um, that keeps our sense of place alive rather than static. And…

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000
One where we continually rediscover what grounds us in…

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000
challenges us and expands our sense of who we are in relation to the world.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
So, for many, maybe 15 to 25-year-olds,

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Maybe it's the sense of place is shaped as much by their digital communities and global influences.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
As by their immediate surroundings, and…

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000
It's so different than how we all grew up, like, in the 70s, when I grew up.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Living somatically, going to the creek,

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Looking at the tadpoles,

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Um, you know, um, learning about things, uh, by hiking or walking, and…

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Um, living in our bodies, in our own physical contexts.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Um, so I just think it's so different. Anyway, I just want to bring up this sense of place.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Thank you very much.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Uh, Gil.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Yeah, I've been… I've been listening to that very thing, Eve.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
context, uh, throughout this whole conversation. Context and norms.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Uh, is what's been echoing me throughout this, and um… and I'm hearing Ken Homer, who's not here yet, uh, with this question, is ever-present question about who's we.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
And the corollary question of who's they?

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Which has been throughout this whole conversation, where, you know, there's a whole we and they thing going on here, and it's very not specific. Um, and it's very relevant, because we're talking about conversations with people who are other in some sort of way.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
you know, different gender, different generation, different geography, different life experience.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Different schooling, different roles, and so forth. Um, so it's something about, um, our expectations across those differences.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Uh, and the acculturation.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Um, the norms, I've… I've…

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Pride and Prejudice has been rolling in my mind.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:16.000
as we're talking here. You know, where there was a richly nurtured culture of propriety and manners and how to speak, and how not to speak.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:27.000
And it's different across different classes, not just between the lords and the servants, but between the landowners and the middle class and the tradespeople in town. They're very different patterns of relationship.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000
and speech and expectation, and what could be asked for. And LP1, I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Louise.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Luis. Yeah, hi Louise. Um, um…

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Louise.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Wait…

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
You know, you talked about how the French are very direct.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:49.000
But the French are different in different parts of France, as the Americans are very different in different parts of the United States.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Trust me, I grew up in New York, and I live in the Bay Area. You know, really different standards and practices about what you talk about and what you don't.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
what you can ask about and what you can't. So, so…

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
All of which is to say that the we who is… who… who…

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000
The we who is raising the question in this conversation, and the they who we are talking about,

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000
is a very important and unstated part of this conversation.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Thanks, Kian. Um, if you want to… if you want to perf…

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
And it's very…

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Very fluid. Sorry.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000
If you want to deepen your own perceptions of the we's and theys,

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
please feel free, because…

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
As always, the elaboration helps us.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Kevin, please.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Yeah, you know, Gil's… comment is actually really right on to where I was going. Um… I worked with a friend with the Eastern Band Cherokee, and we were working on a new product development for them that would diversify their income past casinos.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000
And, uh, we created a thing with them for the taste of Cherokee, and they had some.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Uh… vegetables that were… had been cultivated that had been domesticated, that they could brand.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
And, uh, but the question that they came back with, and they took forever because tribes do.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000
They realized that they did not want to make.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:22.000
food, and it was the taste of Cherokee, right? That was the thing. They said they didn't want to be… make food a commodity. It should be something where if someone is hungry.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
And they come to your door, you feed them. They said that, you know, on the other hand, the Choctaw and the Chickasaw.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:35.000
would have done it. They're more transactional tribes. But the question that… The turkey always asked.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Especially when you're dealing with a Katua band of Cherokee, which are the more traditional and creative.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000
is what does this decision make us in the world.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Under the standpoint of reciprocity, and it's like. Oh, this turns… feeding people into a commodity thing, and we sell it, and, you know, they sell their crops, they're.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Double weave baskets can sell for a couple thousand dollars, because they're… that can hold water, they're amazing.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Um, but… I haven't seen other groups say, what does this decision make us? Because, you know.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
This was going to do a lot for them. You know, they.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:23.000
have casino revenue, and they don't have a lot of other revenue, and uh… But they turned down the chance to make.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
to have a really popular brand in western North Carolina.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Because it… it would make them something that they don't want to be, and so… but it takes a tribe in a circle a long time to make that decision, and so when you're dealing with them.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000
You know, the fastest way to get things done and work with a tribe is to have all the time in the world.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000
And so we had posters made up, we had labels, and they just threw them away.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:57.000
I mean, it was their dollar, but it was, uh… So that's an interesting question, and I don't… I don't see white folks asking that question much.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
It's, uh…

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Um, Kevin, thank you for the story. It seems like they went…

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
They went deep into their culture,

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.000
and thought about what were the influences or effects on their culture of this kind of decision, where we have

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.000
been born into and have assumed away a normalized a transactional environment.
