  "keyThemes": {
    "vestedInterestsSuppressingProgress": {
      "contributor": "Alex Kladitis",
      "core Argument": "Big interests now work AGAINST progress - exception is computing/IT",
      "example": "Best battery ever invented tomorrow? Oil industry + governments would say 'too much economic impact' and buy it out",
      "hegemonicInterests": "Overweight hegemonic interests in world economy suppressing massive disruptive progress",
      "anticipatedPushback": "'You're a conspiracy theorist, Alex' - but thinks this is part of the cycle",
      "jerryConfirmation": "Vested interests kill golden goose progress",
      "historicalExample": "Great American Streetcar Conspiracy - GM, Firestone, Phillips66, Mack Truck bought light rail lines, turned down service, shut down lines, pulled up rails, burned cars → car culture not public transit"

      "gilQuestion": "Question behind the question: What IS progress?",
      "victoriaInChat": "Also asked 'what is progress?'",
      "gilExamples": [
        "Energy transition: renewable > coal globally now, striking price/performance progress over 20-30 years",
        "Medical: wife 11 years in remission from disease that would've killed her in 2 years (cancer research progress)",
        "Personal: induction range, rooftop solar, backup battery switching in microseconds - better experience, same electrons"
      ],
      "gilChallenge": "US lack of progress vs European cities shows progress may be highly localized, not about humanity overall",
      "jerryFraming": "Superficial: dramatic transformation of daily life (grandparents lived through electrification, hygiene revolution)",
      "whereIsMyFlyingCar": "Expected hexacopter Uber by now - but maybe that's not real progress",
      "progressMightBeRelentment": "Maybe real progress is NOT pushing addictive technology on us - progress might be entirely different"
    },
    "mikeNarrowingQuestion": {
      "mikeProposal": "'Provocative and obnoxious': rewrite the question - we've been diverted 10 minutes defining progress, not useful, all have different definitions (Mike has 5+)",

        "Building societies in better ways (societal progress, governance evolution)"
      ],
      "mikeWarning": "Question so broad we'll all talk past each other - each person different place of what progress is most important",
      "alternateFraming": "Quality of daily life improvement over 200 years plateauing or ceasing?",
      "mikeView": "Would argue against globally, but US quality of life not doing well - 'amusing ourselves to death', conflicting demands, Confusopoly (Dilbert term)",
      "confusopoly": "Companies throwing so many options, constantly confusing what product is and how much we pay - no time to sort through crap"

      "contributor": "Mike Nelson",

        "'Enshittification' by Cory Doctorow - why can't we have good things? Why aren't tech breakthroughs leading to customer service + quality of life improvements?",

        "AI might be next large transformation happening right now"
      ],
      "gilCounter": "Behind curtain matters too - rooftop solar, induction range, backup battery = better experience even if 'same electrons'",
      "jerrySkepticism": "Don't particularly want urban airscapes littered with drones/air taxis - fender bender ignorable, quadcopter crash not"
