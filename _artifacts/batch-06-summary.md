# Phase 1 Batch 6 Summary: Call 16
## November 13 Part 2, 2025

## Overview

Batch 6 is a single-call batch: **the conclusion of the two-part curiosity discussion**. While Call 15 (Part 1) explored the premise and theoretical frameworks (Big Five Openness, selection bias), Call 16 (Part 2) shifts to **cultural practices, personal revelations, and methodological proposals**.

The call features extraordinary personal stories (Kevin's cobra, John Kelly in a hyperbaric chamber), profound cultural observations about intimacy and curiosity across contexts, and culminates in **Victoria's methodological pivot**: proposing the Question Formulation Technique to shift OGM from "explaining hypotheses" to "asking questions."

**Call 16 Pattern**: **From Theory to Practice - Cultural Context + Personal Experience + Methodological Shift**

## Call 16: What Happened to Curiosity? Part 2 (Nov 13, 2025)

### Duration and Structure
- **~33 minutes** (shorter than Part 1's ~47 minutes)
- Continuation from Part 1 without recap
- More intimate, conversational tone
- Ends with explicit methodological proposal for future OGM calls

## Cultural Intimacy Gradients and Curiosity

### Kevin Jones - Tribal Transaction Protocols

**Cherokee vs Choctaw Differences**:
- "Want Choctaw to run their business - much more transactional commercial folks"
- "Cherokee Nation much more transactional than Eastern Bend [Cherokee]"
- Even within Cherokee Nation, differences in different formations

**The Probing Taboo**:
- "Fastest way to go slower with a tribe is to probe"
- They say they're going off to think about it → you wait
- "You don't get welcome to the camp if you come into the camp. You get visible. Then you wait, and you get invited when it's time to invite you."
- Kevin's honesty: **"Drives me fucking crazy, but that's what you have to do"**

**Cultural Specificity**: Gil's observation that this is highly contextual - at SOCAP conference, asking process questions welcome. With tribe, unwelcome and counterproductive.

### Jerry Michalski - Intimacy Gradient Framework

**Concentric Rings of Intimacy**:
- Who would you invite to: bedroom → living room → porch → block party?
- Series of concentric rings
- Each culture, within each person, has different settings for who gets to be where
- "In this ring okay to talk about this kind of stuff, not further out"
- Extremes: "People who live their lives fully in public and have no rings, apparently"

**Supporting Stories**:
- **Gil's Maryland friend**: Lived there 20 years before invited from porch into house (friendly conversations on porch, but that's where it was)
- **Kevin's Barcelona friends**: Get invited to cafes, but not to the houses
- Each culture defines intimacy boundaries differently

### Jerry - The Invention of Small Talk

**Joe Gouldy's "Roads to Power"** (digital historian):
- About first turnpikes in England
- Before turnpikes: nobody knew whole country, no map, only knew road to next town
- When started getting roads → carriage rides
- **First time strangers contained in small space**
- Had to invent things like **"Oh, lovely weather outside"**
- Small talk invented in that culture for close confines of long travel in carriage
- "Pervades cultures in all sorts of different ways, probably showed up other ways other places"

**Cultural Evolution**: What we think of as natural social behavior (small talk) was actually invented to solve specific problem (strangers in carriages).

## Personal Curiosity Manifestations

### Alex Kladitis - Need to Understand Everything

**Core Rule**: "Will not use anything, or do anything, or travel in anything, where I don't understand how it works"

**Examples**:
- I know how cars work
- I know how jets work
- **Looked through manual of 747 jet engine when I was 15**
- "Feel the need to know. Wouldn't get on a plane without no notice."
- "That is the inner curiosity that some people have"

**Face Blindness and Social Pattern**:
- "If I see you in another Zoom group, I will not recognize any of you - out of context, different entities"
- "I talk to everyone. I talk to everyone so much. I have no barrier. I will ask them anything."
- **British reserve**: "Can ask about weather, anything not important. As soon as ask remotely personal, goes out window. I upset a lot of strangers, that's okay."

**Brexit Shock - Profoundly Incurious Young People**:
- Sitting at lunch with three people 22-24 years old during Brexit years
- Alex: Started talking about Brexit, political, sensitive
- Them: **"We don't watch the news"**
- Alex: "But it's a big thing, don't you care?"
- Them: **"No. Did you vote? No, we just don't care. We're just not interested."**
- Alex's reaction: **"Profoundly shocked me that there are people in this world that are like that. So incurious."**

### Alex's AI Breakthrough - Game-Changer for Learning

**The Problem**:
- "Could never understand when teacher told me something - comprehension not quite right"
- "Too embarrassed to ask clarifying questions - got really annoying to teacher after answering same question 3 times at different angles, and I still didn't get it"

**The Solution**:
- **"Since ChatGPT came along - Oh. Fantastic."**
- "I ask same question in different ways, and eventually I understand it"
- "Brilliant. Wonder whether kids may benefit."
- **"Don't feel dumb asking same question to AI 50 different times"**
- "Wonder whether that would improve things - teacher and AI to support the teaching"

**Significance**: For people with comprehension differences (learning disabilities, neurodivergence), AI removes shame barrier and enables unlimited patient repetition.

## Extraordinary Moments

### John Kelly - Literally in Hyperbaric Chamber During Call

**The Reveal**:
- "You may notice I'm in different context than earlier in call"
- "Actually in a hyperbaric chamber"
- **Just under 2 atmospheres, about 46% oxygen**
- Nominally therapeutic for certain disease conditions
- **"Also as longevity or cognitive enhancement tool - that's how I'm using it"**

**Noticing**: "One ideas of curiosity was noticing things you don't absolutely have to notice" - then reveals he's in chamber as example of something people might notice if curious.

### John Kelly - Militantly Uncurious Students

**Context**: Taught different levels - young kids, high school, college, adults

**The Students**:
- First-generation college, mill town
- Career goal: **become a shop teacher**
- When started talking about communication: **"When are we gonna laminate?"**
- Had pictures of motorcycles they wanted to laminate
- **"This is college. This is college."** (John's shock and emphasis)

**The Breakthrough - Social Context**:
- "If you created a context where there's social reason for participating and pursuing question like five whys, they'll participate for social reason"
- "Down the road, get benefit - **'oh, we actually discovered something we weren't looking for, wouldn't have done it if told to, but did it in context of playing this little game. Now have different perspective.'**"

**Key Insight**: Social context can create curiosity in "militantly uncurious" people - they participate for social reason, then get intellectual benefit as side effect.

### John Kelly - Five Whys Over-Focus Warning

**Classic Technique**: Keep asking why, why, take apart each answer

**The Warning**: "Possible to over-focus on why when haven't done previous work about what and how"

**Why vs How**:
- **Why** assumes motivation, human actor - good for mystery story
- **How** is more neutral version
- "Other kinds of collaborative coherence of causes you might not notice unless you said how instead of why, and what first"

**Pedagogical Insight**: Sequence matters - what → how → why, not jumping straight to why.

### Kevin Jones - Cobra Story: "Don't Try This at Home"

**Setup** (~25 years ago):
- Rajasthan, Mughal fort
- Fakir doing random pattern to keep cobra
- Woman told Kevin he was hard to follow in dance
- "Wanted to see how it would be with cobra"

**The Experiment**:
- Bought little pipe, got closer, cobra focused on him
- Did his "little funky thing"
- **"Within less than 30 seconds, cobra had me figured out better than Sean McConnell's wife had"**

**Planned Exit**:
- "I planned my exit well"
- "Knew what to do with right hand, left leg, spin behind so he was in line of fire"
- Kids watching

**No Regrets**:
- "Great time. **Moment of being eye-to-eye with cobra is something I would do and don't regret**"
- **"Really glad my kids have not seen me as a role model"**
- Jerry: **"This is a good non-replicable parenting moment"**

## Noticing vs Curiosity Distinction

### Stacey Druss - "We Are All Curious"

**The Blurry Line**: "Little bit of blurry line between the noticing and the curious"

**Fundamental Assertion**: **"I just want to remind everybody, we are all curious"** - just saying that

**The Distinction**:
- "Do believe there are people that just don't notice"
- **"May not have ability to notice"**
- **"If you don't notice in first place, you can't be curious"**
- "Then there are people that notice and they're not curious - there's a difference there"

**Jerry's Response**: "So much of all of this is about how we direct our attention, or how we mind our attention, or what we pay attention to - only that will direct us to be curious and give us the avenue"

**Key Insight**: Noticing is prerequisite for curiosity. Some people can't notice (neurological, attentional). Others notice but aren't curious. Curiosity requires both noticing AND engagement.

## AI in Education - Hope and Concern

### Louise (LP1 - Teacher) - Benefits and Cautions

**The Benefits**:
- "Can see so many benefits"
- Small classes of 24 students, individual attention challenging
- "If have AI bot that can respond, lead, assess and move them on - individual students moving at individual pace"
- "Also at their own level of curiosity, explore a subject"

**Pete's Concern Integrated**:
- "Pete gave me concern - have to have confidence AI capable"
- "Maybe in focused topic/subject, AI could lead students through learning experience"

**Key Insight from Call**:
- **"Curiosity so multifaceted - may not recognize curiosity from student about this maths lesson"**
- **"They probably do have curiosity in some area engrossing for them"**
- **"Mustn't judge them just in environment of my classroom and maths"**
- "Very helpful today"

**Significance**: Teachers may misidentify students as incurious when they're actually curious about things outside classroom context. Call helped Louise recognize this.

### Pete Kaminski - AI Safety Framework

**Context**: Responding to Alex's AI learning breakthrough

**Pete's Practice**:
- Uses ChatGPT for health advice
- Knows health systems, medicine, how it works
- Can ask penetrating questions: "Are you sure you thought about this or that?"
- Feels safe to navigate

**The Warning**:
- **"Wouldn't recommend to most people. Don't do it at home."**
- Washington Post: "Shocking reading about people using these technologies with no clue how it works, getting tricked"
- Not because thing trying to trick, but **"in context where don't have enough information about it"**

**Key Insight**: AI is safe tool if you have domain knowledge to validate. Dangerous if you don't have enough context to know when it's wrong.

## Klaus Mager - Commons Persona of Curiosity

**The Shift**: "We have been reviewing individual curiosity, but there's also a commons persona"

**Brexit Example**: "How was Brexit possible? Because there was..." (cuts off in excerpt)

**Implication**: Curiosity isn't just individual trait - there's collective curiosity, commons-level curiosity. Brexit suggests collective incuriosity or misdirected curiosity.

---

## Victoria's Methodological Pivot - THE BIG PROPOSAL

### The Critique

**Victoria's Assessment**:
- "I love the conversation, I've learned a lot"
- **"But I don't think we have really start to uncover half of what curiosity is about"**
- **"Because we were explaining our hypotheses instead of asking questions"**

**The Pattern**: OGM discussions tend toward explaining theories rather than generating questions. This closes down exploration rather than opening it up.

### Question Formulation Technique

**Source**: Right Question Institute methodology from some years ago

**The Four Rules**:
1. **Ask as many questions as you can**
2. **Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss**
3. **Write down every question exactly as stated**
4. **Change any statements into questions**

**The Process Doesn't End with List**:
- Ends when you **prioritize the questions**
- Decide **what to do with the first three questions in your list**

### Victoria's Success Story - Greek Mythology Seminar

**Original Format**:
- Informal seminar among people interested in Greek mythology
- One person preparing theme for next session
- People would come with questions
- **"Nobody did, nobody asked, of course"**

**After Question Formulation Technique**:
- "I suggested this"
- **"Had so many questions"**
- "Able to really go in direction we wanted"
- Lists of questions, prioritize them, decide what to do

**Outcomes**:
- Some people: "I want to research the hero/heroine difference"
- "I want to go through this other path"
- **Each one decided their own path**
- Instead of standardized sessions (topics everybody talks about), **"really enriched for everybody"**

### Proposal for OGM

**Victoria's Suggestion**:
- "Maybe we can use it at least once?"
- "To uncover anything we can about curiosity or about anything else"
- **"The issue is not the theme, it's that we practice with this"**
- **"Maybe can bring something new to these conversations"**

**Jerry's Interest**: "I like it... I think using this would be great"

**Excalidraw Continuation**: "Can be opened longer, anybody who wants to continue conversation there, that would be great. Always great to have conversation going on."

## Key Takeaways from Curiosity Two-Part Discussion (Calls 15-16)

1. **Selection Bias**: OGM members all high in Big Five Openness - can't assess general population curiosity
2. **Noticing Prerequisite**: Can't be curious about what you don't notice - ability to notice varies
3. **Cultural Context**: Curiosity expression varies wildly - tribal silence, porch-to-house gradients, small talk invention
4. **Manifestation Diversity**: Students may be curious outside classroom (Louise's insight)
5. **AI Shame Removal**: Game-changer for people with comprehension differences (Alex's 50 questions)
6. **Social Context Power**: Militantly uncurious students discover through social participation (John)
7. **Explaining vs Asking**: OGM defaults to explaining hypotheses - Victoria proposes shift to question generation
8. **Question Formulation Technique**: Concrete method for next call - prioritize top 3 questions and decide action
9. **Commons Curiosity**: Not just individual trait, also collective phenomenon (Klaus)
10. **"We Are All Curious"**: Fundamental assertion (Stacey) - but need noticing + engagement

**Victoria's Methodological Pivot** may be most significant outcome - explicit proposal to change how OGM has conversations, shifting from explanation-based to question-based exploration.
