Created: 2025-11-16
Status: Preliminary analysis based on call metadata

- **Notes**: First explicit check-in call. Jerry was planning to be away (mentioned in Call 01).
- **Analysis pending**: Need to read transcript to identify check-in theme/prompt

## Check-In Pattern Analysis

### Frequency
- **3 check-in calls** out of 16 total (18.75%)
- Spacing:
  - Call 02 → Call 06: 4 weeks
  - Call 06 → Call 14: 9 weeks (longer gap)
- Pattern: Roughly monthly check-ins, but not consistent

### Participation
Comparing check-in calls to overall attendance:

**Regular check-in attendees** (attended 2-3 check-in calls):
- Jerry Michalski: 3/3
- Gil Friend: 3/3
- Stacey Druss: 3/3
- Kevin Jones: 3/3
- Klaus Mager: 3/3
- Ken Homer: 2/3 (02, 06)
- Mike Nelson: 3/3
- Doug Breitbart: 2/3 (02, 14)
- Scott Moehring: 2/3 (06, 14)

**Notable**: The core group (Jerry, Gil, Stacey, Kevin, Klaus, Mike) attended all check-in calls, suggesting they value the community connection aspect.

### Participant Growth
- Call 02: 8-9 participants
- Call 06: 11-12 participants
- Call 14: 12-13 participants

Slight growth in check-in attendance over time.

## Hybrid Calls with Check-Ins

**Hypothesis**: Many "hybrid" calls likely start with check-ins before topical discussion.

**To investigate in Phase 1**:
- Do hybrid calls (01, 03-05, 09-12, 15-16) include check-in segments?
- How long are check-ins typically? (15-30 minutes?)
- Are check-ins structured (with prompts) or freeform?
- When do check-ins transition to topical discussion?

---

## Check-In Themes/Prompts

**Status**: Unknown - requires transcript analysis

**Common check-in prompts** (from community practice research):
- "What brought you joy this week?"
- "What are you grateful for?"
- "What's alive in you today?"
- "What are you learning?"
- "What brings you here?"

**Action for Phase 1**: When reading transcripts, note:
1. Whether there's an explicit check-in prompt
2. The prompt/question if given
3. How structured vs. freeform
4. Duration of check-in phase
5. Themes that emerge from check-ins

---

## Check-In vs. Topical Content

### Separation Strategy

For wiki documentation, check-ins should be:
1. **Documented separately** from topical content
2. **Collected** in dedicated check-in pages
3. **Respected** as personal/community content (different from intellectual discussion)
4. **Analyzed** for patterns (joy, challenges, growth themes)

### Check-Ins Hub Structure (Planned)

```
Check-Ins/
├── Check-Ins Hub.md (overview)
├── By Call.md (all check-ins organized by call)
├── By Participant.md (each person's check-ins collected)
├── Themes.md (patterns across check-ins)
└── Check-In Calls/
    ├── Call 02 Check-Ins.md
    ├── Call 06 Check-Ins.md
    └── Call 14 Check-Ins.md
```

---

## Questions for Phase 1

1. **Do check-in calls have topical discussion too**, or are they purely check-ins?
2. **What are the actual check-in prompts** used in each call?
3. **How do hybrid calls structure check-ins** vs. topical content?
4. **Are there recurring personal themes** across participants' check-ins?
5. **How does check-in content inform topical discussions**, if at all?

---

## Preliminary Insights

### Community Practice
- The OGM community values personal connection (18%+ of calls are check-in focused)
- Core members consistently attend check-ins (high regularity)
- Check-in format appears to be an established practice

### Next Steps
- Phase 1: Read check-in call transcripts to identify themes and structure
- Document check-in prompts for each call
- Begin collecting check-in content separately from topical notes
- Track patterns in what people share

## Notes

- This is preliminary analysis based on metadata only
- Full understanding requires transcript reading (Phase 1)
- Check-in content is valuable for understanding:
  - Participant journeys over time
  - Community health and connection
  - Personal context for topical contributions
  - Themes of concern/interest in the community
