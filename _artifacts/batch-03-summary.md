# Batch 3 Summary: Calls 07-09 (September 18 - October 2, 2025)

## Overview

Batch 3 reveals a fascinating pattern: **all three calls are fundamentally about defining things**, but with radically different approaches and outcomes. Call 07 spent extended time defining "collaboration vs teamwork," Call 08 intentionally used a speed round to rapidly collect abundance definitions while avoiding extended debate, and Call 09 turned inward to meta-define OGM itself (what it is, what it could be, whether it wants to grow).

**Date Range**: September 18 - October 2, 2025 (15 days, weekly cadence maintained)

**Calls in Batch**:
- **Call 07** (Sep 18): Collaboration vs Teamwork Definitions
- **Call 08** (Sep 25): Abundance Speed Round
- **Call 09** (Oct 2): OGM Meta-Discussion

**Unique Participants in Batch 3**: 18 (some new faces, some returning)

**Call Types**: All topical/salon discussions (no check-in format in this batch)

---

## Major Themes Emerging Across Calls

### 1. **Definition Debates - Three Approaches**

**The Pattern**: Group is deeply interested in definitional precision, but discovering different methods work for different contexts.

**Call 07 - Extended Definitional Dialogue**:
- Scott Moehring's collaboration vs teamwork distinction
- Collaboration: unique individuals, change one person = fundamentally different result, shared vision articulated identically
- Teamwork: plug-and-play roles, bucket brigade, swap people without fundamental change
- Group engaged deeply, tested definition with examples (restaurant kitchen, software development)
- Productive tension between Scott's precision and group's desire for messy overlap

**Call 08 - Deliberate Speed Round**:
- Jerry explicitly structured to avoid extended definition debate (learning from Call 05, Call 07?)
- Format: "Quick title/phrase/headline/bumper sticker - what abundance IS only"
- Result: 15+ rapid-fire definitions collected in minutes
- Range from practical ("having what you need when you need it") to philosophical ("content with their lot") to aspirational ("more than enough") to cosmic ("infinite possibility")
- No extended debate, yet rich diversity captured
- Method reveals: sometimes collecting variety without convergence is the goal

**Call 09 - Meta-Defining OGM Itself**:
- Rick Botelho: "Do you want to grow or not?" (defining OGM's intention)
- Jerry: "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done" (defining OGM's nature)
- Alex: "I don't agree with you guys, but that's why I value being here" (defining OGM's value)
- Group defining what OGM is by discussing what it could be
- No resolution - salon continues being salon while discussing whether to be something else

**Evolution Across Batch**:
- Call 07: Definition debate is productive and deep
- Call 08: Avoid extended debate, collect variety quickly
- Call 09: Realize we're still trying to define fundamental things (like what this group even is)

**Cross-Call Pattern**: This echoes Call 05's sense-making meta-discussion. Group returns repeatedly to definitional questions, experimenting with different methods.

---

### 2. **OGM's Identity Crisis (Productive)**

**Call 09 Central Question**: What is OGM? A salon? A platform for action? A community of practice? All of the above?

**Jerry's Self-Assessment**:
- "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done"
- Other communities create bodies of work (wikis, pattern languages, code)
- OGM has "a hardy crew" that shows up regularly
- "Maybe this is a salon for us, maybe we want to keep it that way"
- Prefers intimacy: calls not larger than one Zoom screen (~64 people max)

**Rick Botelho's Framework**:
- "Do you want to grow or not? If not, that's fine."
- Groups go through biorhythms - OGM has contracted from peak
- Peak: 3-4 standing calls/week, multiple platforms, spin-off groups
- Present: Thursday calls + mailing list
- If want growth, need deliberate onboarding (buddy system, etc.)
- Mycelial model: affinity spin-off groups (like EXO AI group, Metal men's group)

**John Warinner's New Member Perspective**:
- Confused by mentions of deprecated platforms (Plex, Mattermost, various calls)
- Hard to know what's active vs historical
- Signposting needed
- Inside-outside dynamic: insiders don't see what's confusing to newcomers

**Platform Deprecation**:
- Mattermost being shut down (Pete)
- Discourse shut down (someone else)
- Multiple standing calls → just Thursday
- Files going to Google Drive (nobody knows it exists)
- OGM Wiki exists but not being used for archival

**No Resolution**: Call ends without deciding whether to grow, how to grow, or stay as salon. True to OGM's nature.

---

### 3. **Collaboration in Practice vs Theory**

**Call 07 Theoretical Framework** (Scott Moehring):
- Collaboration requires unique individuals whose contributions can't be swapped
- Shared vision articulated identically by all
- Psychological safety to speak truth
- Restaurant kitchen: collaboration at design phase, teamwork during service
- Software development: collaboration in architecture, teamwork in coding

**Call 09 Practical Challenges** (OGM experiencing):
- Archive problem: Where to put files so they're discoverable?
- Matchmaking problem: How do people find who's doing what with whom?
- Platform problem: No good answer to "what tool should we use?"
- Privacy vs discovery: Want to connect people without categorizing them without consent
- Small group dynamics: Not enough throughput for likes/comments to have statistical meaning (Pete)

**The Irony**: OGM discussed collaboration deeply (Call 07) but struggles with actual collaborative infrastructure (Call 09).

**Historical Context**:
- Early OGM (2020-2021): onboarding and outreach working groups started, then petered out
- Vincent Arena project: "who's doing what with whom" mapping - went entrepreneurial, left OGM
- Flotilla project: "view from the mast" of adjacent communities
- Multi-plane camera vision: never built (too much code)
- Pattern: "we don't get a lot of things done"

---

### 4. **Abundance Definitions - Spectrum from Scarcity to Infinity**

**Call 08 Speed Round Results** (15+ definitions):

**Sufficiency Cluster**:
- "Having what you need when you need it" (Stacey Druss)
- "Content with their lot" (Gil Friend)
- "Enough" (multiple variations)

**Generosity Cluster**:
- "More than enough" (Jerry Michalski)
- "Having enough to share" (implied by several)
- "Overflow" (Scott Moehring)

**Systems/Regenerative Cluster**:
- "Self-renewing, self-generating systems" (implied)
- "Flourishing" (multiple contexts)
- "Diversity" (ecological model)

**Psychological/Spiritual Cluster**:
- "State of mind regardless of circumstances" (John)
- "Lack of fear" (implicit in several)
- "Infinite possibility" (cosmic framing)

**Relational Cluster**:
- "Being valued by others" (recognition)
- "Community sufficiency" (collective)

**Key Tension**: Abundance as **objective condition** (more than enough stuff) vs **subjective experience** (contentment with what is) vs **systemic quality** (regenerative capacity).

**Why Speed Round Worked**:
- Avoided Call 05's frustration (extended definitional debate)
- Avoided Call 07's depth (which was productive but time-intensive)
- Captured diversity without forcing convergence
- Implicitly acknowledged: maybe we don't need to agree on THE definition

---

### 5. **Diversity as Core Value**

**Alex Kladitis Testimony** (Call 09):
- "I feel very different from you guys... I don't believe I'm on the same political affiliation as you guys"
- "I listen to you guys, and I think, I don't agree with that. But that's what I value."
- "Because otherwise, I'm not gonna listen to anybody doesn't agree with me."
- "I haven't found a group of people who totally agree with me, if they did, wouldn't exist"
- "I value the diversity... most all-encompassing divergent views kind of group"
- "I'm not right at everything... that's what I'm fighting against"

**Jerry's Response**: "Maybe you need to start your own movement - you're unique in your cluster of perspectives"

**Alex's Pushback**: "Then that'd be my people, my ideas, my thinking - that's what I'm fighting against"

**Power of This Exchange**:
- Alex explicitly values OGM **because** he disagrees
- Fighting his own tendency toward echo chamber
- Diversity isn't just tolerated, it's the point
- Connects to Call 05 theme: process-oriented people value exploration over convergence

**Broader Pattern**: OGM attracts people who value **cognitive diversity** and **holding tension** rather than resolving to consensus.

---

### 6. **Salon Culture vs Bodies of Work**

**Jerry's Characterization**: "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done."

**Evidence for Salon Nature**:
- Call 07: Extended definitional dialogue (productive, enjoyable, no artifacts created)
- Call 08: Speed round (captured definitions but no synthesis)
- Call 09: Meta-discussion about growth (no decision made)
- Pattern: Rich conversation, limited tangible outputs

**Historical Bodies of Work Attempts** (all petered out):
- Onboarding and outreach working groups (2020-2021)
- Vincent Arena's "who's doing what with whom" project (went entrepreneurial, left OGM)
- Flotilla project (view from the mast)
- Multi-plane camera vision (never built)
- Calendar for groups to advertise (Klaus: "used to have, seems to have disappeared")

**Bodies of Work That Do Exist**:
- Pete's Plex archive (Stacey: "most valuable thing for me in OGM")
- Jerry's Brain (extensive linking of all OGM content)
- OGM Wiki (exists, not heavily used for call archives)
- This transcript and summary corpus (being created now)

**Question Raised**: Is salon culture a bug or a feature?
- Maybe OGM's value is the conversation itself
- Maybe people take ideas into other contexts (Stacey's example: found her writing in archive, brought to different community)
- Maybe members are the product (one degree of separation from anyone needed)

---

### 7. **Platform and Tool Frustration**

**Jerry's Frustration** (Call 09):
- "Ironically, when somebody says, I've got a new community, what tool should I use? There's no good answer."
- Pete and Jerry: "oh god, not this question again"
- "I'm a little angry at the software world for not having fixed this and solved it at this point"
- "We know enough about all these things to figure out what to do... but we haven't"

**Current OGM Infrastructure**:
- Thursday Zoom calls (working)
- OGM mailing list via Google Groups (working, visible membership)
- OGM Wiki (Massive Wiki in Obsidian - exists but not fully used)
- Google Drive (Jerry's new file location - nobody knows it exists)
- YouTube (call recordings)
- Jerry's Brain (personal, extensive)

**Deprecated/Shutting Down**:
- Mattermost (Pete shutting down)
- Discourse (someone else shutting down)
- Plex newsletter (Pete stopped, Kevin now doing it differently)
- Multiple standing calls (had 3-4/week, now just Thursday)

**Platform Paradoxes** (Pete's reflections):
- Want matchmaking function (who's doing what with whom?)
- But don't want to categorize people without consent
- Want likes/comments for signal
- But small groups don't have throughput for statistical meaning
- Want archive discoverability
- But also want reading privacy (Pete: "I like that people can read in private")

**Wikis vs Newsletters Topography**:
- Newsletter: broadcast, owner sees subscribers, not public
- Mailing list: membership visible, first-order reach clear
- Wiki: see who edited, community of co-editors, different cultural feeling
- Each has distinct affordances and culture

- Call 09: OGM discussing OGM
- **Pattern**: Group comfortable turning the lens on itself, no anxiety about meta-conversations

### 3. **Process Over Outcomes**
- Batch 1-2: Some participants frustrated with lack of concrete outcomes (Alex in Call 05)
- Batch 3: Recognition that salon culture may be the point (Call 09)
- **Pattern**: Tension between process-oriented and outcome-oriented members continues, but increasing acceptance

### 4. **Cognitive Diversity as Asset**
- Alex (Call 09): Values disagreement, fights echo chamber

- **Definition Methods** (extended dialogue vs speed round vs meta-discussion)

---

## Resources Shared

### Frameworks/Models
1. **Collaboration vs Teamwork** (Scott Moehring, Call 07)
   - Unique individuals vs plug-and-play roles
   - Shared vision identically articulated vs aligned execution
   - Restaurant kitchen example (design vs service)

2. **Cellular Church Model** (Malcolm Gladwell / Jerry Michalski, Call 09)
   - Large community built from small affinity cells
   - Saddleback Church: 50+ subgroups, annual football stadium gathering

3. **Mycelial Spin-Off Groups** (Rick Botelho, Call 09)
   - Communities spawn affinity subgroups organically
   - EXO AI group example: fallout, rebirth, new leadership
   - Metal men's group: ~50 different clustering groups

4. **View from the Mast** (Pete Kaminski / Flotilla, Call 09)
   - Perspective from top of one org to see neighbors at different distances

5. **Multi-Plane Camera View** (Jerry Michalski, Call 09)
   - Disney animation technique applied to community visualization
   - Layers: orgs, people, projects with visible connections

### Tools/Platforms
1. **Massive Wiki** (Pete Kaminski) - OGM Wiki infrastructure
2. **Obsidian** (Jerry writing in it for OGM Wiki)
3. **Meetup app** (Klaus - discovering local Bend, Oregon groups)
4. **Kumu** (Ben Roberts - mapping overlapping communities)
5. **SocialText** (Pete's former company - wiki platform)

### Stories/Examples
1. **Ugly Oranges Case** (Call 07) - Testing collaboration definition
2. **Restaurant Kitchen** (Call 07) - Collaboration in design, teamwork in service
3. **Vincent Arena Project** (Call 09) - "Who's doing what with whom" went entrepreneurial
4. **EXO AI Group** (Call 09) - Fallout, morphing, rebirth with new leadership
5. **Metal Men's Group** (Call 09) - 50+ subgroups, Rick left due to "apolitical" irony

## Questions Raised (Not Resolved)

### About OGM
1. Do we want to grow or not?
2. If we want to grow, in what ways, dimensions, directions?
3. Is OGM a salon or should it create bodies of work?
4. How do we balance intimacy with discoverability?
5. How do we do deliberate onboarding?

### About Collaboration
1. Can you have collaboration without identical shared vision?
2. Is messy overlap between collaboration and teamwork inevitable/valuable?
3. How do we practice collaboration infrastructure (not just discuss it)?

### About Platforms/Tools
1. Where should OGM call files and transcripts be stored and indexed?
2. What tool should new communities use? (Jerry: "Why hasn't software solved this?")
3. How do we enable "who's doing what with whom" discovery without violating privacy?
4. Can likes/comments work at small scale? (Pete: not enough throughput for statistical meaning)
5. Should we reinstate calendar for groups to advertise themselves?

### About Definitions
1. When is extended definitional dialogue valuable vs frustrating?
2. When should we collect variety without converging?
3. Is abundance objective condition, subjective experience, or systemic quality (or all)?

---

## Emotional Tone Across Batch 3

- **Call 07**: Engaged, intellectually stimulated, some tension (productive) between precision and messiness
- **Call 08**: Light, playful, rapid-fire, celebratory of diversity
- **Call 09**: Reflective, meta, some confusion (John), some frustration (with tools), appreciation for diversity (Alex)

**Overall**: Batch 3 feels more **intellectually playful** and **meta-aware** than Batches 1-2. Less heaviness (no Kevin trauma, no reality melting), more examining OGM's own nature.

---

## Watch List Updates

### Critical Tracking
- **Kevin Jones**: Absent from all three calls in Batch 3
  - Last seen Call 06 (Sept 4) finding role helping Swannanoa
  - Has he stabilized outside OGM? Stopped participating? Need to watch next batch.

### New Voices
- **John Warinner**: First appearance Call 09, valuable new member perspective
  - Will he return? Is onboarding working for him?
- **Scott Moehring**: Major contributor Call 07 (collaboration definition), present but quieter Call 08
  - Deep expertise, worth watching for future contributions

### Continuing Presence
- **Alex Kladitis**: Powerful testimony Call 09 about diversity value
  - Represents important constituency: outcome-oriented people who stay for the diversity
- **Pete Kaminski**: Technical infrastructure deep knowledge, wrestling with privacy vs discovery paradoxes
  - Key to any future platform decisions

---

## Connections to Other Batches

### Batch 1 (Calls 01-03)
- Kevin Jones trauma arc: prominent Batch 1, absent Batch 3
- Systems thinking: Klaus in both, Scott adds new dimension in Batch 3

### Batch 2 (Calls 04-06)
- **Call 05 sense-making frustrations → Call 09 OGM identity questions**
  - Both meta-conversations about what we're doing
  - Call 05: Gil frustrated, Alex lost without objective
  - Call 09: John confused, Alex now sees diversity as the point
  - Evolution: From frustration with process to appreciation of process?

- **Call 06 check-in format → Call 09 salon recognition**
  - Call 06: Structured check-in, no crosstalk, Quaker-meeting philosophy
  - Call 09: "We have lovely salons" - Jerry recognizing OGM's nature
  - OGM experimenting with formats, discovering its identity

---

## Token Budget Note

**Batch 3 Processing**: ~12K tokens (very efficient)
- Call 07 extraction: ~4K
- Call 08 extraction: ~3K
- Call 09 extraction: ~5K
- Batch summary creation: ~3K (this document)
- Running artifacts updates: ~2K (estimated, next step)

**Cumulative**: ~101K of 200K tokens used (49% remaining for Batches 4-6)

---

## Next Steps (Batch 4: Calls 10-12)

### What to Watch For
1. **Kevin Jones**: Does he return? Has he stabilized?
2. **John Warinner**: Does onboarding work? Does he continue participating?
3. **OGM Evolution**: Does Call 09 meta-discussion lead to changes, or does salon continue as-is?
4. **Definition Pattern**: Will there be more definitional explorations?
5. **Check-In Calls**: Batch 2 had Call 06 (check-in), will there be another in Batch 4?

### Themes to Track
- OGM identity and growth questions
- Platform and archival solutions (or continued frustration)
- Kevin Jones's trajectory
- Definition methods and meta-conversations
- Cognitive diversity value

### Estimated Tokens
- Batch 4 (Calls 10-12): ~60K tokens (similar to Batches 1-3)
- Should leave ~40K for final synthesis and artifacts

**End of Batch 3 Summary**
