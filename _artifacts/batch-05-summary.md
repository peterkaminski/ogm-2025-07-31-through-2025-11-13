# Phase 1 Batch 5 Summary: Calls 13-15
## October 30 - November 13 Part 1, 2025

## Overview

Batch 5 represents a dramatic shift from Batch 4's technology interrogation to **systemic critique** (crony capitalism), **consciousness expansion** (Jerry's psilocybin journey, non-local consciousness), and **epistemological questioning** (what happened to curiosity?). The batch includes the third check-in call and the first part of a split two-part discussion on curiosity.

**Batch 5 Pattern**: **Escalating Questions About Systems, Consciousness, and Knowledge**
- Call 13: How do we render crony capitalism obsolete? (systemic corruption)
- Call 14: Consciousness as background radiation, AI bubble as systemic collapse
- Call 15: What happened to curiosity? (knowledge and noticing itself)

## Call 13: How to Render Crony Capitalism Obsolete (Oct 30, 2025)

**Title**: "Crony Capitalism" - Topical Discussion

**Connection to Call 12**: Direct follow-up from Call 12's vested interests suppressing progress theme. Alex's "hegemonic interests suppressing innovation" becomes explicit crony capitalism discussion.

### Three Solution Approaches

**1. Reputational Economies (John Kelly)**:
- Bounded influence: Most people have influence bounded to ~150 people (Dunbar's number)
- Beyond that, need reputational intermediaries
- Example: "I don't know Bob, but Alice knows Bob and I trust Alice, so I'll trust Bob"
- Scalable trust through reputation networks
- Contrast to: Anonymous transactions, purely transactional relationships

**2. Radical Transparency (Alex Kladitis)**:
- Everything in the open, publicly visible
- "Sunlight is the best disinfectant"
- Makes corruption difficult when everyone can see
- Challenge: Requires cultural shift toward valuing transparency
- Example: Open government data, public corporate records

**3. Community Belonging and Stakes (Stacey Druss)**:
- People need to feel they belong and have stake in outcomes
- When disconnected from community, easier to exploit system
- When have skin in the game and community connections, harder to corrupt
- Example: Local community governance vs distant corporate governance

### Stories and Examples

**Russia Kleptocracy - Siloviki (Alex Kladitis)**:
- Post-Soviet security services ("siloviki") became oligarchs
- Mob rule story: Small shop owner facing mob protection racket
- Went to police, police said "we can't help you"
- Went to bigger mob, they said "we'll protect you from first mob, but you pay us more"
- System of nested extraction with no recourse
- Jerry: "Kleptocracy is apt description of current Russian system"

**Copyright Industry Corruption (Mike Nelson)**:
- RIAA/MPAA example of crony capitalism in action
- Industry lobbying captured regulatory process
- Extended copyright terms far beyond original intent
- Prevented innovation in digital distribution
- "Regulatory capture" - regulated industry controls the regulators

### Key Insights

**Shamelessness in the Fake News Era (Stacey Druss)**:
- "People aren't ashamed anymore"
- Used to be if caught doing something wrong, would feel shame
- Now: double down, deny, attack accusers
- Cultural shift away from shame as social control mechanism
- Makes corruption easier when no social penalty for being caught

**John Kelly's Bounded Influence Framework**:
- Most human influence is local (~150 people)
- Beyond that need intermediaries and reputation systems
- Crony capitalism exploits gaps in scaled systems
- Solution may be better reputational intermediaries, not eliminating scale

### Emotional Tone

Frustrated with systemic corruption, seeking practical alternatives, recognizing cultural shifts (shamelessness), analytical about mechanisms of corruption.

## Call 14: OGM Check-in Call - Consciousness, Bubbles, and Cross-Connections (Nov 6, 2025)

**Title**: Third check-in call (following Aug 7 and Sept 4)

### MAJOR TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENTS

**Jerry's First Psilocybin Journey**:
- Never done drugs before in his life
- Day before check-in call (Nov 5)
- Friend in neighborhood, safe setting, friend grew shrooms and tested on himself
- Experience:
  - Felt connected to mycelial networks of the world
  - "Felt like I was everything all at once-ish"
  - Now understands special effects in movies - copying what happens when you see everything
  - "Transformative... don't know how, but it was thrilling"
  - Tried to leave "little dorms or candles or gateways" to step back into experience

**Non-Local Consciousness Convergence**:
Three sources converging for Jerry:
1. **Sunil Malhotra** (1.5 years ago): "What if consciousness isn't materialized from neurons, but is background radiation of universe? We occupy it, tune into it like radio station, when we die we meld back into it."
2. **Dan Brown's "The Secret of Secrets"** (reading Tuesday night before journey): Plot point is non-local consciousness
3. **GABA and Hallucinogens** (from Dan Brown book):
   - Gamma-aminobutyric acid - primary inhibitor in neural system
   - High GABA keeps us from being overwhelmed by stimuli
   - Low GABA: epilepsy (brain overwhelmed, seizure, then moments of bliss connecting with infinite)
   - Hallucinogens seem to reduce GABA so you can perceive what's always happening around you
   - "Not generating hallucination, lowering filters to see what's going on around you"
   - Read about this Tuesday night, had psilocybin journey Wednesday, check-in Thursday

Jerry: "Getting into woo-woo noetic science territory - beginning to respect a lot more"

### Check-In Highlights

**Scott Moehring - Remixability**:
- Kevin McLeod: 2,000 pieces of royalty-free music under Creative Commons
- Most prolific composer you've never heard of (New York Times)
- One song played 31.6 billion times (TikTok, Facebook Reels)
- Concept: Instead of making meals, make ingredients or recipes
- Things other people can and want to use to create things that are theirs
- vs. creating something perfect and self-contained, never to be taken apart

**David Witzel - Growth Metaphors**:
- How do we retrofit abundance/living systems thinking into traditional economics?
- Traditional economics relies on growth; living systems have different growth framework
- Sourdough starter story: Women pioneers kept sourdough alive next to their breasts crossing mountains
- What metaphors from biological growth inform economics in new ways?

**Klaus Mager - Food with Thought**:
- Union of Concerned Scientists "yet another last urgent warning" about climate tipping points
- Missing piece: transition to "what can you actually do about this?"
- Food and agriculture most damaging, but has capacity to regenerate
- Environmental benefits as second crop: farmer has food crop + environmental benefit crop
- Example: Mississippi Delta reducing nitrogen runoff - incentives work even for conservative farmers
- How easy it would be to make an impact, how stubbornly resistant the market is

**Doug Breitbart - Tab Groups Life-Changing**:
- 250 tabs open across browser windows, laptop overwhelmed
- Discovered browser tab groups feature - "This is life-changing for someone like me"
- Core beliefs: Every human being has value to add. What do they need to contribute? How do we meet everyone's needs?
- **OGM as Energetic Center of Gravity**: Touching 12 projects, 60% have OGM in common
- "Starting to coalesce - two independent projects connect, I'm aware of both, aware of how they complement and fit larger context"
- Hat tip to Jerry: "Being the energetic center of gravity out of which a lot of these things connected and met"

### AI Bubble Discussion

**Mike Nelson's Drumbeat**:
- Wall Street Journal daily articles for 3 weeks: "Oh my god, it's an AI bubble!"
- OpenAI is the AOL of our day (overinflated stock price)
- "The U.S. economy is now AI" - all growth for 12+ months from data center investment
- Three bubbles: cloud computing, AI chips, cryptocurrency
- Will it drag down just AI companies, tech sector, or entire market?

**Diverse Perspectives**:

**Pete Kaminski - Weird Territory**:
- "Been in a bubble since about PC era - one big tech bubble inflation thing"
- "AI feels like some kind of endgame - either amazing productivity and social justice, or crash hard because we've turned all matter into GPUs"
- "Likely outcome: some weird thing in the middle"
- "Hard to say this out loud, but feels like we're post cash/gold/Bitcoin questions - wrong questions at this point"
- "We're passed where we've even thought about bubbles. We're in weird territory."

**Doug Breitbart - The End**:
- "Rate energy technology, battery technology, quantum computing progressing: massive billion-dollar data center investments obsolete in 18 months"
- "On intuitive logical level, it doesn't make sense. It's gotta blow up."
- "Biggest players canning 30-50K people to divert resource to constructing data centers"
- "That's the end. Not the beginning of the end. Not a bubble. That's the end of whatever this has been."
- "Reached its insane logical conclusion as a capitalist train run amok"
- "Don't know what's after that, but I do know what's ending. Thank God. It needed to go away. We need to do us differently and better if we're not gonna go extinct."

**Gil Friend - Asset Allocation**:
- "Not one big bubble, it's a series of bubbles - some stabilized, some not"
- Tech sector ~5% GDP pouring more money into economy than consumer sector ~30% GDP - only thing keeping economy afloat
- Microsoft designed net-zero energy and net-zero water data centers (not building them yet)
- Financial advice: "Find your asset allocation strategy and stay there, rebalance periodically"
- Should diversify offshore because of US instability

**Alex Kladitis - Anti-Talent**:
- "Always sold when I should have bought, and bought when I should have sold"
- 40% cash for years because "obviously market's gonna crash" - still hasn't
- "As soon as I'm tempted and buy the market, I will let all of you know - that is a time to get out"
- Blockchain 2015 parallel: NVIDIA cards for Bitcoin mining became obsolete in 18 months
- Created backwash second-hand market - data centers may do same

### Emotional Tone

Transformative (Jerry), concerned apocalyptic (Mike, Doug), philosophical accepting (Pete), methodological practical (Gil), self-deprecating (Alex), systems-thinking hopeful (Klaus, David, Scott), grateful reflective (Doug on OGM).

## Call 15: What Happened to Curiosity? Part 1 (Nov 13, 2025)

**Title**: Collaborative exploration using Excalidraw board

**Victoria's Curation**:
- Created multi-user Excalidraw board with hand-drawn aesthetic
- Caution: "In email thread, given many solutions closing problem early - not what we should strive for"
- Approach: Instead of "Education closes curiosity," ask "Does education close curiosity?"
- "Gather all opinions but show we are not closing, but opening"
- Links curiosity to access, silos, fossil knowledge, academia paywalls

### Immediate Disagreement

**Kevin Jones**: "Is the premise that we are losing, or curiosity is being diminished? If that's it, I completely disagree."

**Jerry's Selection Bias**: "Everybody in this room is really, really curious, and probably hangs out with really curious people. Kids in school seem incurious was the original question."

### Big Five Openness Dimension (Scott Moehring)

**The Model**:
- Openness is one of five statistically verified personality dimensions
- People who are creative, interested in intellectual pursuits, open to new things and ways, curious
- Exists on a spectrum - neither end evolutionarily better (that's why we have spectrum)
- Low openness: sometimes need to be less open, more literal, practical, tradition, history, ritual
- High openness: sometimes need to be more open, accepting, combining, far-reaching
- OGM bias: "This group tends to be high in openness - room attracts those kinds of people"

**Observation**: "If looking for evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to notice instances where people are less curious (those less on the open side). Haven't seen a sea change in that."

### Gil's One-Way Conversations

**Initial Assessment**: "People much younger than me were not curious"

**Evidence**: "Conversations where I would ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions - perplexing"

**Networking Observations**: "Meeting somebody at conference - really struck at how one-way those conversations have been"

**New Strategy**: "Taken recently to start talking about things - what I'm up to, doing, want to talk about, would have wanted to be asked about. Then conversation proceeds normally, interested, back and forth - but initiation, asking questions about somebody else, noticing it in its absence."

**Personal Example That Challenges Age Theory**:
- Woman they've known since she was 12, now ~55
- Dinner few months ago, spent 3 hours together, lovely buffet in backyard
- "Didn't ask a single question of us - not 'How are you doing? How's your life? How's your health?'"
- Context: Knows Jane has been going through major health issues for many years
- Gil's reaction: "Became increasingly uncomfortable, really baffled, didn't figure out what was weird until afterwards, never been in situation like that"
- Significance: "Challenges my assumption that it's a phenomenon of younger people - she's not young"

### Emotional Tone

Exploratory, disagreement acknowledged (Kevin vs premise), discomfort (Gil's one-way conversations), curious about curiosity itself, collaborative (Excalidraw).

## Batch 5 Cross-Call Patterns

### 1. **Systemic Critique Escalates**

From Batch 4's progress debates to explicit systemic analysis:
- **Call 12**: Vested interests suppress progress (Alex)
- **Call 13**: Three solution approaches to crony capitalism
- **Call 14**: AI bubble as end of capitalist train (Doug), weird territory past bubbles (Pete)
- Shift from "is there a problem?" to "what are the solutions?"

### 2. **Consciousness and Epistemology Emerge as New Themes**

**Call 14**:
- Jerry's psilocybin journey (first psychedelic experience ever)
- Non-local consciousness convergence (three sources)
- GABA filters - hallucinogens lower filters to see what's always there
- Noetic science territory

**Call 15**:
- What happened to curiosity? (meta-question about knowledge acquisition)
- Noticing as prerequisite for curiosity
- Selection bias in OGM (all high-openness people)

These represent shift from **what we know** (Batches 1-4) to **how we know** and **what consciousness is** (Batch 5).

### 3. **OGM as Gravitational Center** (Doug's Insight)

Call 14 Doug's revelation:
- 12 projects he's touching
- 60% have OGM in common
- Starting to coalesce - independent projects connecting
- Jerry as "energetic center of gravity"

This addresses Jerry's frustrated vision from Calls 09-10 ("build a global mind... haven't done much") - **OGM is doing it, just not in the way Jerry imagined**. It's enabling connections rather than creating artifacts.

### 4. **Three Check-In Calls Pattern**

- **Call 02** (Aug 7): First check-in - Kevin's deterioration, Ken's Spain move
- **Call 06** (Sept 4): Second check-in - Kevin finding role, Klaus's AI food systems
- **Call 14** (Nov 6): Third check-in - Jerry's transformation, Doug's cross-connections, AI bubble

Check-ins serve as **barometers of personal and collective state**:
- Call 02: Processing trauma, planning escapes
- Call 06: Finding purpose, pivoting strategies
- Call 14: Consciousness expansion, systemic collapse concerns, OGM's hidden impact

### 5. **Methodological Proposals**

- **Call 13**: Three solution frameworks for crony capitalism
- **Call 14**: Multiple investment strategies for AI bubble
- **Call 15**: Excalidraw collaboration, questions not solutions approach

Group moving from identifying problems to proposing methods.

### 6. **Cultural and Generational Questions**

- **Call 13**: Shamelessness in fake news era (Stacey)
- **Call 14**: Young people don't watch news, don't care about Brexit (Alex)
- **Call 15**: Big Five Openness spectrum (Scott), Gil's one-way conversations challenging age theory

Is it generational, cultural, personality, or systemic?

## Thematic Evolution: Batches 1-5

**Batch 1** (Calls 01-03): Grounding - Kevin's crisis, Gil's AI agents, public trust collapse
**Batch 2** (Calls 04-06): Systems thinking - reality melting, sense-making, third places
**Batch 3** (Calls 07-09): Defining - collaboration vs teamwork, abundance, OGM itself
**Batch 4** (Calls 10-12): Interrogating - AI tools, worldviews, progress itself
**Batch 5** (Calls 13-15): **Transforming - consciousness expansion, systemic solutions, epistemological questions**

The arc: **Grounding → Analysis → Definition → Interrogation → Transformation**

## Connections to Running Topics

- **Kevin Jones Recovery**: Update pending (Batch 4 ended with miracle, Batch 5 only has him in Call 15 disagreeing with premise)
- **AI Tools and Critique**: Call 10 practical → Call 12 making things worse → Call 14 bubble/apocalypse → Call 15 as learning aid
- **OGM Identity**: Call 09 "lovely salons, don't get things done" → Call 14 Doug's "gravitational center" insight (hidden impact)
- **Definition Obsession**: Continues in Call 15 (curiosity) with Victoria's methodological proposal
- **Systemic Critique**: Call 12 vested interests → Call 13 crony capitalism solutions → Call 14 AI bubble as end
- **Consciousness NEW**: Jerry's psilocybin journey, non-local consciousness, GABA filters, noetic science

## Open Questions Emerging

1. **Is OGM creating bodies of work invisibly?** Doug's 12 projects, 60% OGM common suggests yes.
2. **What comes after the end of the capitalist train?** (Doug's question)
3. **Are we in weird territory past where we've thought about bubbles?** (Pete)
4. **Is consciousness background radiation of universe?** (Sunil, Dan Brown, Jerry's journey)
5. **How do we shift from explaining hypotheses to asking questions?** (Victoria's proposal for Call 16)
6. **Is lack of curiosity generational, cultural, personality (Openness), or all three?**
7. **Can three solution approaches to crony capitalism work?** (Reputation, transparency, community)
8. **How do we retrofit living systems growth metaphors into economics?** (David)
