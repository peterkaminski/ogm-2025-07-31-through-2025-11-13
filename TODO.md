## Phase 0: Multi-Call Mapping (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)

### 0.1 Inventory All Calls
- [ ] Create comprehensive call inventory spreadsheet/document
  - [ ] Extract dates from directory names
  - [ ] Identify primary topics from directory names and AI summaries
  - [ ] Note call types (Check-in vs Topical vs Hybrid)
  - [ ] List artifacts available for each call (transcript, chat, AI summary)
  - [ ] Count participants (from transcripts/AI summaries)

### 0.2 Map Participants Across Calls
- [ ] Create participant attendance matrix
  - [ ] Extract all unique participant names from all calls
  - [ ] Build matrix showing who attended which calls
  - [ ] Calculate attendance statistics
  - [ ] Categorize participants (Regulars >60%, Frequent 30-60%, Occasional 10-30%, Guests 1-2 calls)
  - [ ] Note first and last appearance for each participant

### 0.3 Topic Mapping Across Calls
- [ ] Skim all call topics (from AI summaries and directory names)
- [ ] Create topic clusters
  - [ ] Identify recurring themes
  - [ ] Group related topics together
  - [ ] Note which calls discuss which topics
- [ ] Build initial thematic structure

### 0.4 Check-In Analysis
- [ ] Identify which calls include check-ins
  - [ ] Note: "2025-08-07 OGM Check-in Call"
  - [ ] Note: "2025-09-04 OGM Check-in Call"
  - [ ] Note: "2025-11-06 OGM Check-in Call"
  - [ ] Check other calls for check-in segments
- [ ] For each check-in call, note:
  - [ ] Check-in theme (if any)
  - [ ] Structured vs freeform
  - [ ] Approximate time spent
  - [ ] Relationship to main topic

## Phase 2: Wiki Structure Design

  /CheckIns/
  /Indexes/
  /Synthesis/
  ```

### 2.2 Create Templates

**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Multi-Call Mapping
**Next Step:** Create inventory of all 16 calls
