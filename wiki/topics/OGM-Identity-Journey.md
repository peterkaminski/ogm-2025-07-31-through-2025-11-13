# OGM Identity Journey

**From Self-Doubt to Hidden Influence: How OGM Discovered Its True Nature Across 3 Calls**

---

## Overview

The OGM group's understanding of its own identity and impact evolved across Calls 05, 09, and 14, moving from self-critical doubt ("just salon conversations") through platform contraction and introspection to profound external validation ("gravitational center" for 60% of 12 projects).

**Timeline**:
- **Call 05** (Aug 28): "Has OGM done sense-making or just salon conversations?"
- **Call 09** (Oct 2): "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done"
- **Call 14** (Nov 6): Doug's revelation - "OGM as energetic center of gravity"

---

## Phase 1: The Self-Doubt Question (Call 05)

### "Has OGM Done Any Sense-Making?"

**Call 05** (Aug 28) - **Jerry's Uncomfortable Admission**

Jerry opened a meta-discussion on sense-making with a pointed self-critique: "OGM hasn't done much sense-making, just salon conversations."

**The Context**:
- Call explicitly about "frustrations with sense-making"
- Group wrestling with definitions of "sense" and "sense-making"
- Tension between process-oriented participants (Marc-Antoine, Ken) and solution-oriented (Alex, Mike)

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Gil Friend, Mike Nelson, Marc-Antoine Parent, Alex Kladitis, Ken Homer

**Key Frustrations Shared**:
- "No thread or objective, solution-oriented people get lost" (Alex)
- "Not clear what we mean by 'sense'" (Gil)
- "OGM hasn't done much sense-making, just salon conversations" (Jerry)
- "Need for complete consensus allows one person to hold all hostage" (Mike)

**Mike's Pushback**:
> "Several of us have used wisdom of this crowd to write very good stuff - look at the broader ecosystem you've engendered"

**Gil's Response**:
> "I don't come to OGM for sense-making (so carry on)"

**The Unresolved Tension**:
- What is OGM's purpose?
- Is "salon conversation" valuable or insufficient?
- Should there be tangible outputs/artifacts?
- Is the process itself the product?

**Pattern**: Jerry questioning OGM's value, others defending different aspects

## Phase 2: Platform Contraction and "Lovely Salons" (Call 09)

### The Confession and the Contradiction

**Call 09** (Oct 2) - **Platforms Deprecating, Identity Crystallizing**

**The Contraction**:
- Mattermost being shut down (Pete)
- Discourse being shut down
- Multiple standing calls (3-4/week) → down to just Thursday
- Spin-off affinity groups deprecated
- Files moved to Google Drive (nobody knows it exists)

**John Warinner's Confusion** (as new member):
- Mentions of Plex, Mattermost, various calls - what's active?
- Hard to navigate, needs signposting
- "Difficult to understand OGM structure"

**Rick Botelho's Central Question**:
> "Critical question: do you want to grow or not? If not, that's fine. Groups go through biorhythms - expansive then contracting. OGM has contracted."

**Jerry's Response**:
> "Not focused on growth, growth, growth. Prefers calls not larger than one Zoom screen (max ~64 people). Likes seeing everybody's faces, expressions, being convivial."

**The Confession**:
> "Characteristic of OGM: **lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done**. Other communities create wikis, pattern languages, code. Maybe this is a salon for us, maybe we want to keep it that way."

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, John Warinner, Pete Kaminski, Rick Botelho, Alex Kladitis, Stacey Druss

**Key Moments**:
- Early OGM (2020-2021): onboarding/outreach working groups started, then petered out
- Vincent Arena left to build "who's doing what with whom" project entrepreneurially
- Pete's Plex "marginally successful, mostly failed" at matchmaking
- Stacey: "Pete's archive was most valuable thing for me in OGM"

**Alex's Testimony on Diversity**:
> "I don't believe I'm on the same political affiliation as you guys. I listen to you guys, and I think, I don't agree with that. **But that's what I value. Because otherwise, I'm not gonna listen to anybody doesn't agree with me.**"

**The Paradox**:
- Contracting while maintaining value
- "Lovely salons" said with affection AND critique
- Not growing but deeply valued by members
- No tangible outputs but archive is treasure

**Unanswered Questions**:
- Do we want to grow? In what ways?
- How do we create bodies of work?
- Is salon conversation enough?
- What's our actual impact?

## Phase 3: The Validation Moment (Call 14)

### "OGM as Energetic Center of Gravity"

**Call 14** (Nov 6) - **Doug Breitbart's Revelation**

**Doug's Personal Breakthrough**:
- Browser tab groups feature changed his life
- 250 tabs → organized groups → machine freed up
- "Things started to flow, not be in overwhelm"
- Unleashed "flood tide of capacity"

**The Cross-Connections Discovery**:
> "Touching bunch of projects - **OGM people or people that have dipped in and out**. Starting to coalesce - two completely independent projects connect, Doug aware of both, aware of how they complement and fit larger context."

**The Validation**:
> "**List of about 12 projects, 60% have OGM in common**"

**Hat Tip to Jerry**:
> "Being the **energetic center of gravity** out of which a lot of these things connected with, met, and now coalesceable"

**Contributors**: Doug Breitbart, Jerry Michalski, others

**What This Revealed**:
- OGM's influence is **mycelial**, not hierarchical
- Impact happens through **connections**, not outputs
- 60% of 12 diverse projects share OGM DNA
- Jerry as "gravitational center" - not organizing but attracting
- "Salon conversations" were actually **network weaving**

**The Transformation**:
- Call 05: "We haven't done much sense-making"
- Call 09: "Lovely salons, but don't get things done"
- Call 14: "**Energetic center of gravity for 60% of 12 projects**"

**Pattern**: Hidden influence realized through external perspective

## The Complete Evolution Arc

### Stage 1: Self-Doubt (Call 05)
- **Question**: "Has OGM done sense-making or just salon conversations?"
- **Frustration**: Process-oriented vs solution-oriented tension
- **Mike's defense**: "You've engendered a broader ecosystem"
- **Unresolved**: What is our purpose?

### Stage 2: Introspection (Call 09)
- **Contraction**: Platforms deprecating, calls reduced
- **Confession**: "Lovely salons, but don't get things done"
- **Growth question**: Do we want to grow? In what ways?
- **Alex's value**: "I don't agree with you, that's why I value this"
- **Paradox**: Contracting while valuable

### Stage 3: External Validation (Call 14)
- **Doug's discovery**: 12 projects, 60% connected through OGM
- **Jerry as center**: "Energetic center of gravity"
- **Reframe**: Not outputs but connections, not hierarchy but mycelium
- **Hidden influence**: Network weaving through "salon conversations"

## Recurring Patterns

### The Salon Question
- **Call 05**: Salon vs sense-making (is salon insufficient?)
- **Call 09**: "Lovely salons" (affectionate but critical)
- **Call 14**: Salon = network weaving (reframed as valuable)

### Inside vs Outside Perspective
- **Rick's insight** (Call 09): "Inside-outside dynamic exists even in welcoming groups"
- **John's confusion** (Call 09): New member reveals onboarding gaps
- **Doug's revelation** (Call 14): External perspective sees connections insiders miss

### Growth Ambivalence
- **Jerry** (Call 09): "Not focused on growth, growth, growth"
- **Preference**: One Zoom screen, see all faces, convivial
- **Early history**: Onboarding/outreach working groups petered out
- **Actual growth**: Mycelial, through connections not expansion

### Bodies of Work Tension
- **Call 05**: Need evidence/artifacts of sense-making?
- **Call 09**: "Other communities create wikis, pattern languages, code"
- **Call 14**: The "body of work" is the network itself

## The Hidden Influence Model

### What OGM Actually Does

**Not**:
- Produce formal outputs (wikis, code, pattern languages)
- Execute projects with deadlines
- Create bodies of work in traditional sense
- Grow through expansion

**But**:
- **Connect unique individuals** across domains
- **Weave networks** through conversation
- **Cross-pollinate ideas** between projects
- **Serve as gravitational center** for mycelial growth
- **Provide diversity** of perspectives (Alex's echo chamber fight)
- **Archive wisdom** (Pete's treasure trove)
- **Enable spin-offs** (Vincent Arena, others)

### The 60% Discovery

Doug's revelation: **12 projects, 60% share OGM in common**

**What This Means**:
- OGM DNA in majority of diverse projects
- Connections made through "salon conversations"
- Jerry as energetic center, not organizer
- Network weaving invisible to participants
- Impact through relationships, not outputs

**The Reframe**: "Lovely salons" were actually **mycelial network formation**
