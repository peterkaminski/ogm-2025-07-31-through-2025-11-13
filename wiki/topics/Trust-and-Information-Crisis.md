# Trust and Information Crisis

**From Underground Networks to Worldview Permeability: The Evolution of Trust Across 4 Calls**

---

## Overview

The OGM group's exploration of trust evolved across Calls 01, 03, 04, and 11, moving from personal trust in high-pressure environments (East Germany) through information trust crisis (contradictory credible sources) to reality trust (AI-generated fakery) to worldview trust (parallel narratives). The arc reveals trust collapsing at every level simultaneously.

**Timeline**:
- **Call 01** (Jul 31): East Germany paradox - deep trust under pressure
- **Call 03** (Aug 14): Information trust - contradictory credible sources, brain defense
- **Call 04** (Aug 21): Reality melting - AI makes everything fakeable
- **Call 11** (Oct 16): Worldview permeability - Al Chang's parallel narratives

**Evolution**: Personal Trust → Information Trust → Reality Trust → Worldview Trust

## Call 01: The Trust Paradox

### East Germany - Deep Trust Under Pressure

**Call 01** (Jul 31) - **Jerry's Foundational Story**

**The Paradox**:
- DDR had 1-in-10 informants (lowest surface trust possible)
- But underground networks had incredibly high trust
- Lives were on the line
- People will never experience trust that deep again

**Jerry's Insight**:
> "East Germany paradox: low-trust surface, high-trust underground networks. Under pressure, deepest trust emerges."

**The Pattern**: Trust is fragile but solid, happens in quirky places

**Context**:
- Call on grief and societal trauma
- German post-WWII processing (Klaus sharing)
- How societies handle collective trauma
- Truth and reconciliation processes

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Klaus Mager, Gil Friend

**Key Observations**:
- **Klaus**: Watching concentration camp footage as child in Germany, generational defensiveness vs shame
- **Gil**: Father's WWII service, intergenerational trauma transmission
- **Jerry**: Trust emerges strongest when stakes are highest

**Resources**:
- "The Lives of Others" (film) - East Germany STASI surveillance state

**The Foundation**:
- Trust isn't linear (more surveillance ≠ less trust)
- High-pressure environments can create deepest trust
- Underground networks operate on different trust physics
- What looks like low-trust society may have hidden high-trust pockets

**Question Raised**: Can we create that depth of trust without existential pressure?

## Call 03: The Information Trust Crisis

### Contradictory Credible Sources

**Call 03** (Aug 14) - **Mike Nelson's Expertise**

**The Problem**:
- How do we know what information to trust?
- Multiple credible sources contradict each other
- Forwarding info to group = putting reputation behind it
- Can't figure out "what's so" even with discernment

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Mike Nelson, Gil Friend

**Key Themes**:

### Gaza Information War

**Gil Friend's Frustration**:
- Multiple credible sources contradict each other
- Israel blocking foreign journalists
- Israeli public has limited news access about Gaza
- Rising anti-war sentiment in Israel
- **Can't figure out "what's so" even with discernment**

### Mike Nelson's Disinformation Expertise

**The Mechanics**:

**Misattributed Quotes Epidemic**:
- Marcus Aurelius quote: "Far better to be rejected by society than subsumed by a mob of idiots"
- Actually Leo Tolstoy made it up and attributed it to Marcus Aurelius
- Happens constantly

**Elon Musk-Baltimore Ravens Story**:
- $500M sponsorship offer
- Spread widely in last 24 hours
- Completely made up but plausible
- Shows how false but plausible stories spread rapidly

**11 Ways to Fight Disinformation**:
- Alicia Wanless / Carnegie project
- Problem: None work really well
- Most lack business model
- Strong business model for spreading disinformation
- No business model for fighting it

**Mike's Reframe**: **"Brain Defense" not "Media Literacy"**
> "Better framing - about defending against hateful, ignorant, deceitful memes and bumper stickers"

**Focus Should Be**: Amplifiers/forwarders, not just sources

### The Death of Journalism

**Jerry's Observation**:
> "Protracted, agonizing death of journalism. What replaces it? People always need information even in terrible situations."

### Electronic Graffiti

**Concept** (Singapore company 20 years ago):
- App allowing annotations/corrections on any website
- Visible to other app users
- Failed business model, never worked
- Group interested in revival

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Mike Nelson, Gil Friend

**Key Moments**:

**Quote Investigator** and **Snopes**: Trusted resources for verification

**Gil's Insight**:
> "Lies move fast, truth corrects slowly"

**The Business Model Problem**:
- Profitable to spread disinformation
- Not profitable to fight it
- Structural incentive problem

**Questions Raised**:
- How do trusted communities avoid being spun?
- What replaces journalism?
- How do we handle contradictory credible sources?
- Can we create something like electronic graffiti that works?

## Call 04: Reality Melting

### AI Makes Everything Fakeable

**Call 04** (Aug 21) - **Ted Joya's Warning**

**Trigger**: Article "Assured Reality Will Self-Destruct in the Next 12 Months"

**The Crisis**:

**Reality Melting**:
- Can't tell AI-generated music/content from human-created
- Photographic evidence no longer documentary
- Stuart Brand prediction (mid-70s): Photos can't be trusted
- No shared narrative like 3 TV networks provided
- **Won't agree on facts because can't be sure what actually happened**
- Misdirection planted everywhere

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Gil Friend, Alex Kladitis, Klaus Mager

**Key Insights**:

### Gil Friend - Reality as Collective Hunch

**The Ontological Question**:
> "How do we know anyway? We're all constructing meaning from sensory input."

**Lily Tomlin Quote** (from "Search for Intelligent Life of the Universe"):
> "Reality is highly overrated, it's just a **collective hunch**"

**Gil's Challenge**:
- Cultural commitment to veracity is gone or going
- Many people don't give a shit about veracity anymore
- Even 3 news networks weren't "facts" but selective narratives
- Did we really have shared facts, or just shared narratives?

### Stuart Brand's Prediction

**Mid-1970s Warning**:
- When early Photoshop precursors emerged
- Predicted photographic evidence would no longer be documentary
- Now fully realized with AI

### Political Corruption Paired

**Klaus, Alex, Jerry's Observations**:

**In-Your-Face Corruption**:
- Texas redistricting: brutal "what are you gonna do about it"
- Gerrymandering tolerated across democracies (US, UK)
- Trump evaded 91 indictments
- System's inability to stop corruption astonishing
- Press doesn't challenge, mainstream media complicit

**The Connection**: When AI makes reality unknowable, authoritarian power exploits epistemic chaos

### People's Capacity to Excuse

**Alex Kladitis**:
> "We have no idea what the hell is going on. Used to know my position clearly, now can only guess. People's capacity to excuse is **dramatically deep**. We excuse, forget, and just adapt to new reality."

**Jerry's Agreement**:
- Humans are very adaptable
- Perception can be shifted by repetition
- Bellman's Fallacy: "Anything you say three times is true" (Lewis Carroll)

### Ken Homer's Poem - "Afraid So"

**Closing** (read twice by request):

Series of anxious questions, each answered "Afraid so":
- "Is it starting to rain?"
- "Did the check bounce?"
- "Are we out of coffee?"
- "Could you lose your job?"
- "Are we lost?"
- "Can it get any worse?"

**Jerry**: "Like a tour of the universe."
**Doug**: "Priceless and troubling all at once."

**Perfect capture**: Pervasive anxiety about reality melting

**Resources**:
- Ted Joya article on reality self-destructing
- "The Capture" (Netflix series) - video manipulation thriller
- Lily Tomlin's "Search for Intelligent Life of the Universe"

**Pattern**: When reality itself becomes unverifiable, everything downstream collapses

**Questions Raised**:
- How do we know what's real when AI generates convincing fakes?
- Did we really have shared facts with 3 TV networks?
- How do democracies tolerate obvious corruption?
- Will people wake up when reforms fail, or keep excusing?

## Call 11: Worldview Permeability

### Parallel Narratives and Steel-Manning

**Call 11** (Oct 16) - **Dealing with Uncomfortable News**

**Jerry's Framing**:
> "Left-leaning group processing Trump achieving Gaza ceasefire and Venezuela progress - how do we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview?"

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Gil Friend, Mike Nelson, Kevin Jones

**Key Themes**:

### Al Chang's Parallel Narratives Insight

**Jerry's Friend Al Chang**:
- Set of facts on the ground
- Left and right see roughly the same facts
- But have **completely different movie scripts/narratives** around them
- Both narratives are relatively consistent and work
- **Two sides can't see or read each other's narratives - incapable**

**Jerry's Question**:
> "How do I steel man the opposing narrative? How do I put my brain into it and listen for different parts?"

### Jerry's AI Steel-Manning Method

**The Method**:
> "Asked Claude and ChatGPT: 'What has Trump actually done?' Discovered his people have been on the ground doing stuff that hasn't been done before in multiple places."

**Examples**:
- Trump Gaza ceasefire: all October 7 hostages resolved
- Maria Corina Machado (Nobel Peace Prize) dedicated award to Trump
- Venezuela: Trump sent Navy offshore, $40M bounty on Maduro

**Application**: Using AI to understand opposing perspectives, not just confirm own views

**Significance**: AI as tool for cognitive flexibility, not just information retrieval

### Gil's Cautious Update

**Gil Friend's Response**:
> "Cautiously impressed with Trump Middle East work, but don't give Peace Prize for starting initiatives. Challenges my picture of 'bumbling, narcissistic baby guy' - doesn't mean he can't do some things successfully."

**Pattern**: Worldview updating - one thing moves over, maybe

### Mike Nelson's "Cosplay Diplomacy"

**Critique of Trump's Claims**:
- Temporary deals without substance
- Afghanistan parallel: talked to Taliban not Afghan government, vague deal with no checks, timed withdrawal after he left office
- Gaza: "deal" in NYC real estate sense (common goal, figure out details later)
- Hamas explicitly said they didn't agree to disarm part of "deal"

**Mike's Warning**:
> "Let's wait 5 years and look back. No diplomat would claim what Hamas half-agreed to is a final deal."

**Skepticism**: Claims of stopping wars are temporary, lack substance, "cosplay" rather than real diplomacy

### Mike's Personal Worldview Shock

**Carnegie Scholar Scandal**:
- Two days before call: top Carnegie analyst (Mike's favorite colleague)
- House raided by FBI, found 1000+ top-secret/confidential documents
- Advisor to State Department, knows how to handle classified docs
- Stories emerging: is he a spy for Chinese? (not accused yet)

**Mike's Reaction**:
> "Completely disconnect from everything I know about this scholar, makes no sense. Having very hard time dealing with it. Don't know how I will."

**Jerry's Response**:
> "Perfect example of ill-fitting news in our worldview. Do we allow worldviews to be permeable to things like that?"

### Maria Corina Machado's Nobel Dedication

**The Dedication**:
> "I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!"

**The Nation Reaction**: Article calling it "sellout, terrible"

**Backstory**: Trump only president who actually sent Navy offshore, did stuff helpful against Maduro

**Mike's Alternate Reading**:
> "She's in a bind. Has to be as obsequious as possible. Someone angry he doesn't have Peace Prize, she needs his help. Do words reflect what she really believes?"

**The Question**: How much is strategy vs actual belief?

**Emerging Pattern**: Worldview permeability - how rigid vs flexible are our frameworks?

**Questions Raised**:
- How do we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview?
- Do we allow worldviews to be permeable?
- How do we steel man opposing narratives?
- Is Trump's diplomacy real or cosplay?
- How does someone so smart do something so stupid? (Mike's colleague)

## The Paradoxes

### Paradox 1: Trust Under Pressure

**Call 01 - East Germany**:
- More surveillance → Lower surface trust
- But higher stakes → Deeper underground trust
- **Pattern**: Trust isn't linear, operates on different physics under pressure

### Paradox 2: Knowledge Abundance = Less Certainty

**Progression**:
- More information sources → Can't tell which to trust
- Better AI tools → Harder to verify what's real
- More news → Less shared reality
- **Pattern**: Abundance of information creates scarcity of trust

### Paradox 3: Adaptability as Vulnerability

**Call 04 - Alex's Insight**:
- Humans' capacity to adapt is strength
- But also vulnerability: excuse, forget, adapt to terrible new reality
- **Pattern**: Our resilience enables normalization of unacceptable

### Paradox 4: Both Narratives Work

**Call 11 - Al Chang's Observation**:
- Left and right see same facts
- Completely different narratives
- **Both narratives are internally consistent**
- Neither side can see the other's
- **Pattern**: Multiple incompatible realities can be coherent
