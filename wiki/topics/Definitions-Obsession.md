# Definitions Obsession

**From "What IS Sense?" to Speed Rounds: How OGM Wrestles With Words Across 6 Calls**

---

## Overview

The OGM group returns compulsively to definitional questions across Calls 05, 07, 08, 09, 12, and 15, experimenting with different approaches to handle the tension between precise definitions and expansive shared meaning. Three distinct methods emerge: extended dialogue (frustrating), precise frameworks (productive), and speed rounds (innovative).

**Timeline**:
- **Call 05** (Aug 28): What IS sense-making? Extended frustrating debate
- **Call 07** (Sep 11): Collaboration vs teamwork - Scott's precise framework
- **Call 08** (Sep 26): Abundance - Stacey's speed round innovation
- **Call 09** (Oct 2): What IS OGM? Meta-definition of group itself
- **Call 12** (Oct 23): What IS progress? Immediate fragmentation
- **Call 15** (Nov 13): What IS curiosity? Big Five Openness framework

## Call 05: The Frustrating Spiral

### "What Do We Mean by 'Sense'?"

**Call 05** (Aug 28) - **Gil's Fundamental Challenge**

**The Setup**:
- Jerry proposed topic: "Frustrations with sense-making"
- Group sharing frustrations before solutions

**Gil's Bombshell**:
> "Not clear what we mean by 'sense'"

**Gil's Questions**:
- Does sense mean interpretation of reality satisfying to me?
- Does it mean shared interpretation?
- Does it mean shared commitment to action, consent, decisions, coordination?
- Most conversation seems about goals/decision-making - is that a subset?
- Premature attention to goals implies tacit sense-making already happened

**The Extended Debate**:
- What is evidence that sense-making has happened?
- What are remainders/artifacts of sense-making?
- Should "sense-making" have a hyphen?

**Contributors**: Gil Friend, Jerry Michalski, Marc-Antoine Parent, Ken Homer, Rick Botelho, Doug Breitbart, Alex Kladitis

**Key Moments**:

**Marc-Antoine's Defense**:
> "We're negotiating shared meaning right now - that's the process. We're always arguing about words because we're arguing with words. Don't expect formal definition to emerge or be agreed on. **Illusion of consensus is terrible** - we think we mean same thing, we don't."

**Ken Homer's Approach - Expansive vs Reductive**:
- **Yosemite story**: 35 people, 400+ words/phrases about "conflict" on post-its
- Arranged by bothersomeness
- "Organ failure" = conflict so bad might have heart attack
- After seeing it, everyone included it in their understanding
- **Principle**: "Let everyone say what they think, don't nail down to fine definition"
- **Exponentially synthetic** vs reductive

**Rick Botelho's Grounding**:
> "Need Weick's definition of sense-making as grounding, then critique where you differ"

**Alex Kladitis - Lost in Process**:
> "Not academic, more practical - you say this, you mean that. Solution-oriented, couldn't find thread without objective."

**Jerry's Reflection**:
> "Should have started with a couple definitions, might have helped"

**The Outcome**:
- Call ended without resolving what sense-making is
- Perfect meta-illustration: discussing sense-making illustrated exact problems
- Alex as barometer: represents audience who needs concrete outcomes
- Gil as skeptic: doesn't come to OGM for sense-making

**Pattern**: Extended definitional debate → frustration → no resolution

## Call 07: The Precise Framework

### Collaboration vs Teamwork - Scott's Distinction

**Call 07** (Sep 11) - **Productive Definitional Clarity**

**Scott Moehring's Clear Framework**:

**Collaboration**:
- Unique individuals pairing/grouping up
- Creating something they couldn't create separately
- Not because of manpower but because of **unique interaction**
- Change one person = fundamentally different result
- Shared vision both can articulate the same way
- Result named after individuals/organizations involved

**Teamwork**:
- Plug-and-play roles, bucket brigade
- Someone in charge, someone sets vision
- Everyone fulfills their role
- Can swap people in same role without fundamental change
- Executing recipes already created

**Scott's Test**:
> "If collaborators can't say what they're doing in the same way, maybe they're not actually collaborating"

**Contributors**: Scott Moehring, Jerry Michalski, Gil Friend, Kevin Jones, Mike Nelson

**Key Moments**:

**Examples That Clarified**:
- **Restaurant**: Head chef + restaurateur developing = collaboration; kitchen executing recipes = teamwork
- **Film**: Hollywood roles (gaffer, grip) = teamwork; Mike Lee inventing script with actors = collaboration
- **Ugly Oranges** (Jerry's case): Two teams need oranges, discover complementary needs (pith vs juice), split and collaborate

**Skepticism Emerged**:

**Mike Nelson**:
> "Often 1 person does 80% of work, 4 people take all credit. Some of those 4 actually getting in the way. Need champion with deadline and motivation. Collaborations can wander without deadline."

**Kevin Jones**:
> "I've done that a lot, and you get... you know, Barney, I like you, you like me, but nobody changes from their own goals. Like ships passing, lower drawbridge briefly."

**Gil's Concern**:
> "Very problematic conversation - debating words we're using in different ways about meanings we aren't clear about"

**The Paradox**:
- Clearest definition yet (Scott's framework)
- But life experience varies (Scott sees it rarely, Gil sees it everywhere)
- Practical skeptics (Kevin, Mike) have tried and failed at cross-organizational work

**Pattern**: Precise framework → productive discussion → reveals experience differences

## Call 08: The Speed Round Innovation

### Abundance - Stacey's Process Breakthrough

**Call 08** (Sep 26) - **Avoiding the Definition Spiral**

**Stacey Druss's Proposal**:
- Speed round before usual conversation rounds
- Quick title/phrase/headline/bumper sticker
- What it IS only (not how/where/when/why)
- Can say "pass"
- Refrain from explaining initially

**Email Closing**: "'Thank you for attention to this matter' with wink" (mocking Trump Truth Social posts)

**Contributors**: Stacey Druss, Gil Friend, jessie (Jessie Upp), Pete Kaminski, Klaus Mager, Doug Breitbart, Jerry Michalski, John Warinner, Rick Botelho

**The Definitions**:

**Stacey Druss**: "Having what you need when you need it"

**Gil Friend** (Pirkei Avot - Jewish wisdom):
> "Who is rich? The person who is content with their lot"

**jessie (Jessie Upp)**: "Ikigai" (overlap of what you love, what you're good at, what world needs, what you can get paid for)

**Pete Kaminski**: "Love is all you need" (Beatles)

**Klaus Mager**: "To be at peace with the gifts you have been given"

**Doug Breitbart**: "Infinite possibility"

**Jerry Michalski**: "More than enough" (self-described as "slightly controversial")

**John Warinner**: "More than enough" (agreed with Jerry)

**Rick Botelho**: "Co-intelligence"

**Alex Kladitis**: "Pass"

**Thematic Clusters**:
- **Sufficiency**: Having what you need, more than enough, content with lot
- **Inner state**: Content, at peace, love
- **Alignment**: Ikigai, co-intelligence
- **Expansiveness**: Infinite possibility

**Jerry's Surprise**:
> "Surprised how early in call everyone was so focused. People were pithy and right on mission."

**The Innovation**:
- Got diverse definitions on table quickly
- Avoided extended debate (unlike Call 05)
- Speed constraints forced clarity
- Alex passed (consistent with Call 05 solution-orientation)
- Format worked - group stayed focused

**Pattern**: Speed round → diverse definitions → no prolonged debate → productive

## Call 09: The Meta-Definition

### What IS OGM?

**Call 09** (Oct 2) - **Defining the Group Itself**

**The Central Question** (Rick Botelho):
> "Do you want to grow or not? If not, that's fine."

**What This Forced**:
- Group to define itself
- Purpose, structure, identity
- Salon vs bodies of work
- Growth intentions

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Rick Botelho, John Warinner, Pete Kaminski, Alex Kladitis, Stacey Druss

**Definitional Fragments**:

**Jerry**:
> "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done. Other communities create wikis, pattern languages, code. Maybe this is a salon for us, maybe we want to keep it that way."

**John Warinner** (new member confusion):
- Mentions of Plex, Mattermost, various calls - what's active?
- Hard to know where to go for what
- Signposting needed

**Rick's Framework**:
- Groups have biorhythms - expansive then contracting
- OGM has contracted (fewer calls, platforms)
- Mycelial spin-off groups model
- Inside-outside dynamic invisible to insiders

**Alex's Definition Through Value**:
> "I don't believe I'm on the same political affiliation as you guys. I don't agree with that. **But that's what I value. Because otherwise, I'm not gonna listen to anybody doesn't agree with me.**"

**The Non-Resolution**:
- Question posed but not answered
- "Do we want to grow?" - unresolved
- "What are we?" - salon? network? community?
- Call true to salon nature - ended without defining

**Pattern**: Meta-definition attempt → reveals identity questions → no closure (appropriately)

## Call 12: The Fragmentation

### What IS Progress?

**Call 12** (Oct 23) - **Immediate Definitional Breakdown**

**The Question**: "Has progress stopped?"

**Immediate Fragmentation**:

**Alex Kladitis**: "Vested interests suppress progress - exception is computing/IT"

**Gil Friend**: "Question behind the question: What IS progress?"
- Energy transition (renewables > coal)
- Medical (wife's cancer remission)
- Personal (induction range, rooftop solar)
- Challenge: US vs European cities - progress may be localized

**Jerry Michalski**: "Superficial: dramatic transformation of daily life"
- Grandparents: electrification, hygiene revolution
- Where is my flying car?
- "Maybe real progress is NOT pushing addictive technology on us"

**Mike Nelson's Intervention**:
> "'Provocative and obnoxious': rewrite the question - we've been diverted 10 minutes defining progress, not useful, all have different definitions (I have 5+)"

**Mike's Narrowing Attempt**: "Are there more barriers to technological development than in the past?"

**Mike's Progress Dimensions**:
1. Scientific/research discoveries
2. Applying discoveries in cool new technologies
3. Economic barriers preventing use (super battery example)
4. Building societies in better ways (societal progress, governance)

**Mike's Warning**:
> "Question so broad we'll all talk past each other - each person different place of what progress is most important"

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Alex Kladitis, Gil Friend, Mike Nelson, Victoria (in chat: "What is progress?")

**The Pattern**:
- Broad question posed
- Immediate definitional fragmentation
- Mike attempts to narrow
- Group continues with multiple definitions
- Enshittification theme emerges (why don't breakthroughs improve life?)

**Outcome**: Call continued productively DESPITE definitional chaos - accepted multiplicity

## Call 15: The Selection Bias

### What IS Curiosity?

**Call 15** (Nov 13 Part 1) - **Big Five Openness Framework**

**The Question**: "What happened to curiosity?"

**Immediate Challenges**:

**Kevin Jones**: "Is the premise that we are losing curiosity? If that's it, I completely disagree."

**Jerry's Selection Bias Observation**:
> "We have a selection bias problem - everybody in this room is really, really curious, and probably hangs out with really curious people"

**Scott Moehring's Framework - Big Five Openness**:
- Statistically verified personality model
- **Openness** = one of five dimensions
- High openness: creative, intellectual pursuits, open to new things, curious
- Low openness: literal, practical, tradition, history, ritual
- **Neither end is evolutionarily better** - spectrum exists for reasons
- **OGM bias**: This group tends to be high in openness
- "If looking for evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to notice instances where people are less curious"

**Gil's Observations**:
- Younger people in one-way conversations (don't ask questions)
- 55-year-old friend: 3-hour dinner, asked zero questions
- Not generational - personality?

**Victoria's Approach** (Excalidraw board):
- Frame as questions not solutions
- "Does education close curiosity?" not "Education closes curiosity"
- Open possibilities, don't close down
- Link to access, silos, "fossil knowledge" (books)

**Contributors**: Scott Moehring, Jerry Michalski, Kevin Jones, Gil Friend, Victoria (Spain)

**Key Moments**:

**Scott's Evolutionary Neutrality**:
> "Sometimes you need to be less open and more literal, practical, tradition, history, ritual. Sometimes you need to be more open, accepting, combining, far-reaching."

**Victoria's Framing Wisdom**:
> "In email thread, given many solutions closing the problem very early - not what we should strive for. State as question: opens more things to work with."

**The Pattern**:
- Definitional question posed
- Framework provided (Big Five Openness)
- Selection bias acknowledged
- Approach: questions not solutions
- Multiplicity honored

## The Complete Evolution Arc

### Three Approaches Emerge

**1. Extended Dialogue (Call 05 - Frustrating)**:
- What IS sense-making?
- Hours of debate
- No resolution
- Gil: "Debating words we're using in different ways"
- Marc-Antoine: "Illusion of consensus is terrible"
- Outcome: Frustration, some insights (Ken's expansive approach)

**2. Precise Framework (Call 07 - Productive)**:
- Scott's collaboration vs teamwork distinction
- Clear, testable criteria
- Examples that clarify
- Skepticism from life experience (Kevin, Mike)
- Outcome: Productive discussion, reveals experience differences

**3. Speed Round (Call 08 - Innovative)**:
- Stacey's format innovation
- Quick definitions, no debate initially
- Diverse views on table fast
- Avoids extended spiral
- Outcome: Focused, efficient, multiple perspectives honored

### Recurring Definitional Questions

**Call 05**: What IS sense? / What IS sense-making?
**Call 07**: What IS collaboration? (vs teamwork)
**Call 08**: What IS abundance?
**Call 09**: What IS OGM?
**Call 12**: What IS progress?
**Call 15**: What IS curiosity?

### The Pattern Across Calls

**Stage 1**: Big question posed
**Stage 2**: Multiple interpretations emerge
**Stage 3a**: Extended debate (Call 05) OR precise framework (Call 07) OR speed round (Call 08)
**Stage 4**: Either frustration OR productive difference OR accepted multiplicity

---

## Recurring Patterns

### Expansive vs Reductive Tension

**Ken Homer's Principle** (Call 05):
> "Let everyone say what they think, don't nail down to fine definition. Exponentially synthetic vs reductive."

**Marc-Antoine's Warning** (Call 05):
> "Illusion of consensus is terrible - we think we mean same thing, we don't."

**Application**:
- Call 05: Ken's Yosemite conflict workshop - 400+ words, expansive shared meaning
- Call 07: Scott's precise framework - reductive but clarifying
- Call 08: Stacey's speed round - both (diverse definitions, no forced consensus)

### Process vs Outcome Orientation

**Process-Oriented**:
- Marc-Antoine: "Negotiating shared meaning IS the work"
- Ken: Expansive definitions, let everyone contribute
- Victoria: Questions not solutions, open not close

**Outcome-Oriented**:
- Alex: "Solution-oriented, couldn't find thread" (Call 05)
- Mike: "Narrow the question or we'll talk past each other" (Call 12)
- Rick: "Need Weick's definition as grounding" (Call 05)

**The Dance**: Neither approach wins - group cycles between both

### Selection Bias Awareness

**Call 15 - Scott's Insight**:
> "This group tends to be high in openness - room attracts those kinds of people. If looking for evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to notice instances."

**Implications**:
- OGM members are definitionally curious
- Self-selected for exploring ideas
- Bias toward wanting to define things
- May not represent broader patterns

### Format Innovation Learning

**Progression**:
- **Call 05**: Extended frustrating debate
- **Call 07**: Precise framework (Scott learned from Call 05?)
- **Call 08**: Speed round (Stacey learned from Calls 05 + 07?)
- **Call 12**: Accepted fragmentation (Mike: "I have 5+ definitions")
- **Call 15**: Questions not solutions (Victoria learned from all previous?)

**Group Learning**: Experimenting with different approaches to handle definitional obsession

## The Three Methods in Detail

### Method 1: Extended Dialogue

**Example**: Call 05 - What IS sense-making?

**Approach**:
- Open-ended exploration
- Multiple voices contributing
- No time constraints
- No forced resolution

**Pros**:
- Reveals assumptions
- Diverse perspectives heard
- Process-oriented people engaged
- Deep exploration possible

**Cons**:
- Can spiral indefinitely
- Solution-oriented people get lost (Alex)
- May not reach clarity
- Frustrating for some (Gil)

**Best For**: Exploring complex concepts, building shared understanding, honoring multiplicity

### Method 2: Precise Framework

**Example**: Call 07 - Collaboration vs Teamwork

**Approach**:
- Clear criteria presented
- Testable distinctions
- Examples that clarify
- Debate on applicability

**Pros**:
- Enables productive discussion
- Gives shared language
- Reveals experience differences
- Concrete and actionable

**Cons**:
- May oversimplify
- Life experience varies (Scott sees it rarely, Gil everywhere)
- Can miss nuance
- One person's framework may not fit all

**Best For**: Operational clarity, decision-making, creating shared language for specific purposes

### Method 3: Speed Round

**Example**: Call 08 - Abundance

**Approach**:
- Quick definitions (bumper sticker)
- What it IS only
- Can pass
- No initial explanation/debate

**Pros**:
- Efficient
- Honors multiplicity
- Avoids extended debate
- Diverse views on table fast
- Focus maintained

**Cons**:
- May not go deep
- Can feel rushed
- Some may struggle (Alex passed)
- Follow-up needed for depth

**Best For**: Getting diverse views quickly, avoiding definitional spirals, setting stage for focused discussion

---

## The Paradox

### Simultaneous Truths

1. **Definitions are essential** for shared understanding and action
2. **Definitions are problematic** - create illusion of consensus (Marc-Antoine)
3. **Process of defining is valuable** even without resolution (Ken's expansive approach)
4. **Too much defining wastes time** (Mike's "talk past each other" warning)

**All four can be true simultaneously**

### The Resolution

**Group has learned**:
- No single approach works for all questions
- Process-oriented and outcome-oriented people both have valid needs
- Format matters - experiment with different methods
- Multiplicity can be honored without forced consensus
- Selection bias means OGM will always wrestle with definitions

**Pattern**: The group's **obsession with definitions** may be its **defining characteristic**

---

## Connections to Other Themes

### OGM Identity (Calls 05, 09, 14)
- **Call 05**: Defining sense-making → questioning OGM's purpose
- **Call 09**: "What IS OGM?" - meta-definition attempt
- **Connection**: Group defines itself through wrestling with definitions

### Collaboration and Process (Call 07)
- **Scott's framework**: Clear distinction enables discussion
- **Kevin/Mike skepticism**: Life experience challenges definitions
- **Connection**: Defining helps and hinders collaboration

### Trust and Information Crisis (Calls 01, 03, 04, 11)
- **Call 04**: "Reality is a collective hunch" (Gil) - definitions depend on shared reality
- **Call 11**: Al Chang's parallel narratives - different definitions for same facts
- **Connection**: Definitional debates reflect epistemological crisis

---

## Unanswered Questions

1. **Can we ever have shared definitions?** (Marc-Antoine: illusion of consensus is terrible)
2. **Should we try for precision or honor multiplicity?** (Ken vs Scott approaches)
3. **What's the right balance of time spent defining?** (Mike's concern)
4. **How do we include solution-oriented people in definitional discussions?** (Alex's challenge)
5. **Is our obsession with definitions productive or problematic?** (Both?)
6. **When is speed round appropriate vs extended dialogue?** (Context-dependent?)
7. **How do we know when definitional work is "done"?** (Maybe it never is?)
