# AI and Technology Evolution

**From Reality Melting to Learning Tools: How OGM's AI Conversation Evolved Across 5 Calls**

---

## Overview

The OGM group's relationship with AI and technology evolved dramatically across Calls 04, 10, 14, 15, and 16, moving from existential crisis ("reality melting") through practical innovation ("AI as participant") to personal transformation ("learning breakthrough") and apocalyptic reckoning ("the end").

**Timeline**:
- **Call 04** (Aug 21): Reality melting - AI makes everything fake
- **Call 10** (Oct 9): AI as conversation participant - practical reframe
- **Call 14** (Nov 6): AI bubble consensus - economic apocalypse
- **Call 15** (Nov 13 Part 1): AI in learning - selection bias
- **Call 16** (Nov 13 Part 2): AI learning breakthrough - accessibility tool

---

## Phase 1: Epistemological Crisis (Call 04)

### "Reality is Melting"

**Call 04** (Aug 21) - **Ted Joya Article**: "Reality Melting in the AI Age"

**The Crisis**:
- AI-generated content indistinguishable from human (music, images, video)
- Photographic evidence no longer documentary
- Stuart Brand prediction (mid-70s): Photos can't be trusted
- No shared narrative like 3 TV networks used to provide
- **Won't agree on facts because can't be sure what actually happened**
- Cultural commitment to veracity is gone or going
- Reality is "a collective hunch" (Lily Tomlin)

**Contributors**: Jerry Michalski, Gil Friend, Alex Kladitis

**Paired with**: Political corruption normalization
- Texas redistricting brutal "what are you gonna do about it"
- Trump evaded 91 indictments
- System's inability to stop corruption astonishing
- Capacity to excuse "dramatically deep"

**Pattern**: When AI makes reality unknowable, authoritarian power exploits epistemic chaos

**Question Raised**: Can we have shared facts without shared narratives?

## Phase 2: Practical Reframe (Call 10)

### "AI as Conversation Participant" - John Warinner's Epiphany

**Call 10** (Oct 9) - **Major Conceptual Shift**

**John Warinner's Light Bulb Moment**:
> "Everyone having revealing one-on-one AI explorations. Want to share, but bombarding each other with loquacious 2,000-4,000 word exchanges. **Light bulb: Why aren't LLMs just participants in THIS conversation?**"

**The Problem**: Bandwidth overload from sharing AI outputs

**The Solution**: AI as group participant, not just 1-on-1 tool

**ChatGPT's Response**: ~2 years away, in the pipeline

**Gene Bellinger Wisdom** (via John):
> "**The mapping, not the map**" - value is in conversation process, not product

**Practical Tools Already Working**:
- **Stacey**: LLM podcast converter
- **Jerry**: Anonymized focus groups - AI as "excellent listeners and summarizers"
- **Shawn Murphy**: Thinkertoys - real-time collaborative knowledge with AI, graph visualizations
- **Jerry's pi.ai story**: Surprised by AI insights about his own thinking patterns

**Doug Breitbart**: "Common understanding for better decision-making in complex systems"

**Shift**: From existential threat (Call 04) → Practical tool for group sense-making

## Phase 3: Economic Apocalypse (Call 14)

### AI Bubble Consensus + Data Center Obsolescence

**Call 14** (Nov 6) - **Wall Street Journal Drumbeat**

**Mike Nelson**:
- At least one article daily for 3 weeks: "Oh my god, it's an AI bubble!"
- **AOL parallel**: OpenAI is the AOL of our day, completely overinflated stock price
- **Altman strategy**: Doing exactly right thing - using it to buy, do deals that won't look good in 1-2 years
- **Economy now AI**: All growth for 12+ months because of data center investment - take that out, economy's been flat
- **Three bubbles**: Cloud computing, AI chips, cryptocurrency

**Questions**:
- Will it drag down just AI companies, entire tech sector, or entire market?
- Where do you put the money? (Gold up 3x because people confused)
- How many thinking of pulling profits from tech investments?

**Poll**: Most hands up - there's a bubble. 3.5 hands - changing investment strategy.

**Pete Kaminski - "Weird Territory"**:
> "Been in a bubble since PC era - one big tech bubble inflation thing going up and down. Feels like some kind of **endgame** - either amazing productivity and social justice, or crash hard because we've turned all matter into GPUs. Some weird thing in the middle."

> "It's hard to say this out loud to professional people who care, but it feels like **we're kind of post cash/gold/Bitcoin questions**. All of that seems like the wrong questions at this point. We're passed where we've even thought about bubbles. **We're in weird territory.**"

**Gil Friend**:
- Not one big bubble, it's a series - some stabilized, some not
- 2008 parallel: Government bailed out some banks, not others - too-big-to-fail game
- **Ben Hunt numbers**: Tech sector ~5% of GDP pouring more money than consumer sector ~30% - only thing keeping economy afloat
- Microsoft net-zero data centers designed but not built

**Doug Breitbart - "That's the End"**:
> "Rate at which energy technology, battery technology, quantum computing progressing. **Massive billion-dollar data center investments obsolete in 18 months.**"

> "On intuitive logical level, it doesn't make sense. **It's gotta blow up.** When it's too good to be true, it defies reality."

> "Biggest players canning 30, 40, 50K people to divert resource to constructing data centers."

> "**That's the end. Not the beginning of the end. Not a bubble. That's the end of whatever this has been.** Reached its insane logical conclusion as a capitalist train run amok. Don't know what's after that, but I do know what's ending. **Thank God. It needed to go away. We need to do us differently and better if we're not gonna go extinct.**"

**Alex Kladitis - Blockchain Parallel**:
- NVIDIA skyrocketed for Bitcoin mining cards (2015)
- Graphics cards became obsolete within 18 months (exactly as Doug said)
- Created backwash second-hand market for games
- **Maybe data centers becoming obsolete produce cheap alternative computing power for something**

**Shift**: From practical tool (Call 10) → Economic apocalypse warning

## Phase 4: Learning & Accessibility (Calls 15-16)

### AI as Tool for Neurodivergent Learning

**Call 15** (Nov 13 Part 1) - **Selection Bias**

**Scott Moehring - Big Five Openness**:
- OGM members likely all score high on Openness dimension
- **Selection bias**: Everyone attending likely highly curious
- Self-selection into group exploring ideas

**AI Context**: Group discussing curiosity, but all already curious - AI discussion similar pattern?

**Call 16** (Nov 13 Part 2) - **Alex's BREAKTHROUGH**

**Alex Kladitis - Face Blindness & Comprehension Differences**:
> "Could never understand when teacher told me something - comprehension not quite right. Too embarrassed to ask clarifying questions - got annoying to teacher after 3 times at different angles."

**The AI Solution**:
> "Since ChatGPT came along - **Oh. Fantastic. I ask same question in different ways, and eventually I understand it.**"

**The Benefit**:
> "**Brilliant. Wonder whether kids may benefit. Don't feel dumb asking same question to AI 50 different times.**"

**The Proposal**:
> "Wonder whether that would improve things - teacher and AI to support the teaching"

**Louise (LP1) - Teacher's Perspective**:
- So many benefits - have small classes of 24 students, but individual focused attention challenging
- Vision: AI bot that can respond, lead, assess and move students on - individual pace
- Concern (from Pete's warning): Have to have confidence AI capable
- Insight: "Curiosity so multifaceted - may not recognize curiosity from student about maths lesson, but they probably do have curiosity in some area engrossing for them"

**Pete Kaminski - AI Safety Warning**:
> "Wouldn't recommend to most people. **Don't do it at home.** Washington Post: Shocking reading about people using these technologies with no clue how it works, getting tricked."

**Pattern**: AI power requires AI literacy - dangerous in hands of those who don't understand limitations, but transformative for those who understand context

**Shift**: From economic apocalypse (Call 14) → Personal transformation (Call 16 - accessibility breakthrough)

## Recurring Themes

### Enshittification (Calls 10, 12, 14)

**Gil's Question** (Call 10):
> "Is enshittification tightly correlated with monetization?"

**The Pattern**:
- Call 10: Can platforms sustain economically without enshittification?
- Call 12: Customer service degradation DESPITE AI tools - call centers using AI to divert away from goals
- Call 14: AI bubble as ultimate enshittification - all economy, no actual value

**Cory Doctorow book**: "Enshittification: Why Can't We Have Good Things?"

**Core Question**: Why aren't technological breakthroughs leading to quality of life improvements?

**Confusopoly** (Dilbert): Companies confuse products/pricing to prevent comparison

---

### AI & Consciousness (Call 14)

**Jerry's Psilocybin Journey Convergence**:
- **Non-local consciousness theory** (Sunil Malhotra 1.5 years prior): "What if consciousness isn't materialized from neurons, but is background radiation of universe?"
- **GABA insight**: Hallucinogens reduce GABA (neural inhibitor) so you can perceive what's always happening
- **Jerry's experience**: "Felt connected to mycelial networks of the world. I was everything all at once-ish."

**The Connection**: Same week as AI bubble discussion - consciousness expansion + economic reckoning

**Pattern**: Technology interrogation (AI bubble) paired with consciousness exploration (psilocybin journey)

---

### Jerry's AI Steel-Manning (Call 11)

**Worldview Challenge Context**:
- Left-leaning group processing Trump Gaza ceasefire
- How do we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview?

**Jerry's Method**:
> "Asked Claude and ChatGPT: 'What has Trump actually done?' Discovered his people have been on the ground doing stuff that hasn't been done before in multiple places."

**Application**: Using AI to understand opposing perspectives, not just confirm own views

**Significance**: AI as tool for cognitive flexibility, not just information retrieval
