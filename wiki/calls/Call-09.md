# Call 09: OGM Meta - Growth, Platforms, and Identity

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Type**: Meta-discussion / Salon
**Duration**: ~90 minutes (estimate)
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

---

## Quick Summary

**THE meta-call** where OGM examined its own structure, identity, and future. John Warinner (new member) revealed onboarding confusion, Rick Botelho asked the central question: "Do you want to grow or not?", Jerry confessed "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done," and **Alex testified**: "I don't agree with you guys, but that's why I value being here" - fighting his own echo chamber. The call mapped OGM's contraction (multiple platforms deprecated, 3-4 calls/week down to 1), explored mycelial spin-off groups, and wrestled with the unsolved problem: "What tool should new communities use? **There's no good answer**."

## Key Themes

### Platform Deprecation - OGM's Contraction

**John Warinner + Pete Kaminski + Jerry**

**What's being shut down**:
- **Mattermost** being deprecated (Pete shutting down)
- **Discourse** being shut down (someone else's decision)
- Used to have **3-4 standing calls per week**, now down to just Thursday
- **Multiple spin-off groups** (collaboration, abundance, etc.) deprecated
- Files now going to **Google Drive** (Jerry created, but nobody knows it exists)
- **OGM Wiki** exists but not being used for archival

**John's confusion**: New member hearing mentions of Plex, Mattermost, various calls - **difficult to navigate what's active vs deprecated**.

**Pattern**: OGM has **contracted** significantly from peak period.

**Rick's framing**: "Groups go through biorhythms - expansive then contracting. OGM has contracted."

---

### Rick's Central Question: Do You Want to Grow?

**The growth question**

**Rick's framing**:
- "Critical question: **do you want to grow or not?** If not, that's fine."
- Groups go through biorhythms - expansive then contracting
- OGM has contracted (fewer calls, fewer platforms)
- If want to grow, need **deliberate onboarding** (buddy system, etc.)
- **Inside-outside dynamic exists** even in welcoming groups
- Mycelial nature - spin-off affinity groups model
- EXO AI group example: had fallout, morphed, got new leadership, now expanding

**Jerry's response**:
- "Question is for the group, not for Jerry alone"
- **Not focused on growth, growth, growth**
- Prefers calls **not larger than one Zoom screen** (max ~64 people)
- Likes seeing everybody's faces, expressions, being convivial
- Early OGM had onboarding/outreach working groups - **efforts petered out**
- **"We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done"**
- Other communities create bodies of work (wikis, pattern languages, code)

**John's addition**: "Companion question: **In what ways? What dimensions? What directions?** Growth without intention is ridiculous."

**Significance**: Group explicitly questioning purpose and direction - meta-awareness of limitations.

---

### Jerry's Self-Assessment: Salons vs Bodies of Work

**THE key admission**

**Jerry's observation**:
- **"Characteristic of OGM: We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done"**
- Other communities create wikis, pattern languages, code
- OGM has "a hardy crew" that shows up regularly
- Maybe this is a salon for us, maybe we want to keep it that way
- Open to all suggestions, not attached to specific outcome

**Contextual history**:
- Early OGM (2020-2021): Onboarding and outreach working groups started, then **petered out**
- Multiple standing calls (3-4/week) deprecated down to just Thursday
- Spin-off affinity groups existed (exactly what Rick suggested) but **Jerry stepped out of them**

**Mike's response**: "Several of us have used wisdom of this crowd to write very good stuff - look at broader ecosystem you've engendered."

**Significance**: Jerry defining OGM as salon, not project - accepting what it is rather than what he might have wanted it to be.

---

### Alex's Testimony: Valuing Disagreement

**PROFOUND MOMENT**

**Alex's statement**:
- "I feel very different from everyone: **'I don't believe I'm on the same political affiliation as you guys'**"
- "I listen to you guys, and I think, I don't agree with that"
- **"But that's what I value. Because otherwise, I'm not gonna listen to anybody doesn't agree with me."**
- Haven't found group who totally agrees with him - **if they did, wouldn't exist**
- Values the diversity - **most all-encompassing divergent views group**
- Frustrated sometimes (want to expand on topics), but can form subgroups
- There's a limit how many groups you can join in one week
- **"I'm not right at everything" - fighting against own echo chamber**

**Jerry's response**: "Maybe you need to start your own movement - you're unique in your cluster of perspectives"

**Alex's pushback**: "Then that'd be my people, my ideas, my thinking - **that's what I'm fighting against**"

**Significance**: Powerful articulation of why diversity matters - not just nice to have, but essential for avoiding echo chambers. Alex staying precisely because he disagrees.

---

### The Unsolved Platform Problem

**Jerry's frustration**

**Jerry's critique**:
- **"Ironically, when somebody says, I've got a new community, what tool should I use? There's no good answer."**
- Pete and Jerry with lots of experience: **"oh god, not this question again"**
- Could try Discord, Google group, this, that - all have pluses and minuses
- **Facebook has eaten the space**, business model is **addicting you** - not cool
- LinkedIn very business-y, private LinkedIn groups don't have much life
- **"I'm a little angry at the software world for not having fixed this and solved it at this point"**
- "We know enough about all these things to figure out what to do... but we haven't"

**Platform options mentioned**: Discord, Google Groups, Signal, Matrix, Slack, Mattermost, Facebook, LinkedIn

**Significance**: 4+ years into OGM, core infrastructure problem still unsolved. No good community platform exists.

### Pete's Plex: Matchmaking Failure

**Pete Kaminski's reflection on what didn't work**

**The vision**:
- "Plex goal: who's doing what where? Help people find out more."
- Missing global **"matchmaking function"** - what would friends-of-friends find interesting?

**Why it failed**:
- Felt marginally successful, mostly failed
- **Devilishly difficult to get that information from people**
- Not because closed-lipped, but because **context-dependent**
- Example: "Where do I hang out? Today with Jesse, is that what you mean?"
- **Vincent Arena example**: Doing amazing stuff, no time to sit around and share
- Didn't track Plex readership, didn't want to categorize people
- Wanted to give people **agency**, not assume collective categorization

**Critical insight**: **Likes and comments would need critical mass** (like Amazon, Facebook) - small group doesn't have enough throughput for statistical meaning

**Privacy paradox**: Want matchmaking but don't want to categorize people without consent

**Stacey's value**: "Pete's archive was most valuable thing for her in OGM. Found something she wrote, brought it to different community."

**Significance**: Good ideas for community coordination often fail because they don't work at small scale.

---

### Stacey: One Degree of Separation

**Stacey Druss's perspective**

**Core belief**: "Everyone is one degree of separation from anyone they need to know"

**How she views OGM**: "Looks at everyone as a page in her own book"

**Archive value**:
- **Pete's archive was most valuable thing** for her
- Found something she wrote, brought it to different community
- Wants calls archived so can add pieces to "pages"
- **Members are important** - they go to different places, make up different groups

**Mailing list preference**: Prefers OGM mailing list (knows rough audience) over Plex (no idea who reads)

**Significance**: For some people, OGM is connective tissue between communities - archive and relationships matter more than live conversation.

---

### Mycelial Spin-Off Groups

**Rick Botelho + Jerry's models**

**Rick's examples**:

**EXO AI group**:
- Had affiliated AI subgroup
- Leadership had **fallout** between main group and AI subgroup
- AI group went independent, then morphed with new leadership
- Now **expanding again**
- Spin-off group from AI group focused on human flourishing (Rick pushed for "human and planetary flourishing")

**Metal men's group**:
- Group Rick used to belong to but left (apolitical, which was ironic)
- Had **~50 different subgroups** (clustering, infinities, crypto, etc.)
- Incredible to see breadth of affinity groups
- **Self-organizing, self-generating, self-governing** spin-off groups

**Jerry's example - Cellular Church**:
- Malcolm Gladwell article on Saddleback Church (Rick Warren)
- Got giant through **cell structure**: Colton Group, downhill bikers, etc.
- Little cells with common interests
- Once a year all gathered in local **football stadium** because couldn't fit in church

**Significance**: OGM had this (spin-off groups), deprecated them. Rick's question: Should we revive this model?

## Stories Shared

### Rick: EXO AI Group Fallout and Rebirth

**Summary**: EXO community had affiliated AI subgroup. Leadership fallout between main and AI groups. AI group went independent, morphed with new leadership, now expanding. Spin-off from AI group focused on human flourishing.

**Impact**: Example of mycelial spin-off groups - **inhibitory and pro-growth strategies** working together.

### Rick: Metal Men's Group Structure

**Summary**: ~50 different subgroups (clustering, infinities, crypto, etc.). Incredible breadth of affinity groups. Self-organizing, self-generating, self-governing.

**Impact**: Model for distributed community organization.

### Jerry: Malcolm Gladwell's Cellular Church

**Summary**: Saddleback Church where Rick Warren was pastor. Got giant through cell structure: little affinity cells. Once a year gathered in football stadium.

**Impact**: Model for scaled community with intimate affinity cells.

### Jerry: Vincent Arena's "Who's Doing What With Whom" Project

**Summary**: Early OGM question. Vincent came straight out of college, started project to map groups and members. Went entrepreneurial, built it up, went off. Still doing it. Hasn't been in OGM for quite a while.

**Impact**: Example of someone taking OGM-spawned idea and building independently.

### Jerry: View from the Mast / Flotilla Project

**Summary**: Pete's metaphor - lots of overlapping raindrop-y organizations swimming in flotilla. If you go to top of OGM mast and look out, some orgs closer, some on horizon. Some have overlapping members.

**Impact**: Conceptual model for understanding community adjacency.

### Jerry: Multi-Plane Camera View

**Summary**: Disney invented multi-plane camera for cartoons - layers of cells moving at different speeds create depth illusion. Jerry wanted this for OGM: one layer = orgs, another = people, another = projects. Could see connections between layers, turn around, pull out. More code than anyone wanted to create.

**Impact**: Aspirational model for visualizing multi-dimensional community relationships.

## Frameworks Introduced

### Cellular Church Model

**Source**: Malcolm Gladwell article / Saddleback Church
**Description**: Large community built from many small affinity cells that gather once a year

### Mycelial/Rhizomal Spin-Off Groups

**Source**: Rick Botelho, Jerry Michalski
**Description**: Community spawns affinity subgroups organically, groups can split and recombine

### View from the Mast

**Source**: Pete Kaminski / Flotilla project
**Description**: Perspective from top of one organization's mast to see neighboring orgs at different distances

### Multi-Plane Camera View

**Source**: Jerry Michalski (from Disney animation technique)
**Description**: Layered visualization showing orgs, people, projects as separate planes with visible connections

### Publish and See Who Complains/Adds

**Source**: Pete Kaminski
**Description**: Heuristic for discovery - make what you know public, learn from responses

### Inside-Outside Dynamic

**Source**: Rick Botelho
**Description**: Even welcoming groups have insider perspective that's invisible to insiders but clear to newcomers

## Questions Raised

- Do we want to grow or not?
- If we want to grow, in what ways, dimensions, directions?
- How do we do deliberate onboarding (buddy system, etc.)?
- How do we make OGM content discoverable and useful?
- Where should call files and transcripts be stored and indexed?
- Is OGM Wiki the right place for call archives?
- How do we balance salon conversation with creating bodies of work?
- What tools should new communities use? (Why hasn't software world solved this?)
- How do we enable "who's doing what with whom" discovery without violating privacy?
- How do we create matchmaking function for friends-of-friends interests?
- Should we reinstate calendar for groups to advertise themselves?
- Should we re-nurture mycelial spin-off groups?
- How do we value diversity of views while also having depth?
- Can we have likes/comments features at small scale?

## Cross-Call Connections

### Backward Connections

- **Call 05** - Sense-making meta-discussion → Call 09 OGM structure meta-discussion (group comfortable with meta-conversations)
- **Call 07** - Collaboration definitions → actual collaboration challenges in OGM practice
- **Call 02** - Jerry away in Italy, Klaus hosted → Jerry reflecting on OGM's salon nature vs getting things done

### Forward Connections

- **Call 10** - Continues meta-discussion, John Warinner's epiphany about AI as group participant
- **Call 14** - Doug's insight: 12 projects, 60% have OGM in common - Jerry as "energetic center of gravity"

### Thematic Connections

**Completes Batch 3: Foundations** (Calls 07-09)

Call 09 turns definitional lens on OGM itself. Pattern: Define collaboration (Call 07) → Define abundance (Call 08) → **Define OGM** (Call 09). Batch ends with self-awareness but no resolution.

---

## Batch Context

**Batch 3 (Calls 07-09): Foundations**

Call 09 completes batch by examining OGM's own foundations. Group discovers it's a salon, not project. Alex's testimony about valuing disagreement becomes key to understanding OGM's value.

**Note**: Kevin Jones **ABSENT** (3rd and final call). Returns minimally Call 10, triumphantly Call 11 with Mennonite miracle.
