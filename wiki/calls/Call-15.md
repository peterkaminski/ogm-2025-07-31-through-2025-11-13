# Call 15: What Happened to Curiosity? (Part 1)

**Date**: November 13, 2025 (Part 1 of 2-part call)
**Type**: Hybrid (Topical + Collaborative)
**Duration**: ~47 minutes (Part 1)
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski
**Collaborative Tool**: Excalidraw board (Victoria, Spain)

---

## Quick Summary

**Victoria (Spain) created a collaborative Excalidraw board** exploring curiosity, deliberately framing as questions not solutions ("Does education close curiosity?" vs "Education closes curiosity"). **Kevin Jones flatly disagreed with the premise** that curiosity is being diminished. **Jerry acknowledged selection bias** - everyone in OGM is really curious, probably hangs out with curious people. **Scott introduced Big Five Openness dimension** - neither end evolutionarily better, OGM attracts high-openness people. **Gil shared discomfort with one-way conversations** - especially 3-hour dinner with 55-year-old friend who asked zero questions. This is Part 1; Part 2 continues as Call 16.

## Key Themes

### Victoria's Excalidraw Curation - Questions Not Solutions

**Collaborative visual thinking**

**Setup**:
- Created **multi-user Excalidraw board** with hand-drawn aesthetic
- Took **snapshot of board state** so "if everything is messed, it doesn't matter"

**Caution**: "In email thread, given many solutions **closing the problem very early** - not what we should strive for"

**Approach**: Instead of "Education closes curiosity," state as question: **"Does education close curiosity?"** - opens more things to work with

**Jerry's clarification**: "Positing multiple theories instead of choosing one to close it down"

**Victoria's goal**: "Gather all opinions but show we are **not closing, but opening**"

**Ongoing theme**: "Like when I first talked to Jerry and he said trust and consumerism were his things, I understood **curiosity has been always a concern for me**"

**Linking**: Issue of access links to books as **"fossil knowledge"** (trapped), silos, academia paid subscriptions - a lot of things going on

**Proposal**: "Gather everything and start thinking how this **relates to different OGM projects**, or different things that can start from here"

**Significance**: Methodological innovation - visual collaborative space, deliberate question framing to keep exploration open. Echoes Stacey's Call 08 speed round format learning.

---

### Kevin's Flat Disagreement

**Challenging the premise**

**Kevin Jones**:
- "Is the premise that we are losing, or curiosity is being diminished?"
- **"If that's it, I completely disagree"**
- Tone: **"So I'm curious"** (ironic)

**Significance**: Kevin's flat disagreement sets up debate - is curiosity actually diminishing, or is this perception?

---

### Jerry: Selection Bias Problem

**OGM is all curious people**

**Original question**: "Hey, kids in school seem incurious"

**General agreement**: "In general, the room will agree with Kevin: no, no, no"

**Bias**: **"We have a selection bias problem - everybody in this room is really, really curious, and probably hangs out with really curious people"**

**Significance**: Meta-awareness - OGM can't answer "is curiosity diminishing?" because everyone here is high-curiosity. Need outside perspective.

---

### Scott: Big Five Openness Dimension

**Personality psychology framework**

**Big Five model**: Statistically verified personality model

**Five dimensions**: Openness is one of the five

**Openness**:
- People who tend to be **creative, interested in intellectual pursuits**
- Open to new things and new ways
- **Curious**

**Spectrum**: "Exists on a spectrum - there are people who are **low in openness**"

**Evolutionary neutrality**: **"Neither end of the spectrum is evolutionarily better, which is why we have the spectrum"**

**Low openness value**: "Sometimes you need to be **less open and more literal, practical, tradition, history, ritual**"

**High openness value**: "Sometimes you need to be more open, accepting, combining, far-reaching"

**OGM bias**: "This group tends to be **high in openness** - room attracts those kinds of people"

**Scott's observation**: "If looking for evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to notice instances where people are less curious (those less on the open side)"

**Scott's view**: "Haven't seen a sea change in that - **believe it exists on a range**"

**Significance**: Reframes question from temporal ("curiosity declining") to distributional ("we're noticing low-openness people because we're high-openness"). Not change over time but observer bias.

### Gil: One-Way Conversations

**Noticing lack of reciprocal curiosity**

**Initial assessment**: "People much younger than me were not curious"

**Evidence**: "Conversations where I would **ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions** - perplexing"

**Networking situations**: "Meeting somebody at conference - really struck at how **one-way those conversations have been**"

**New strategy**: "Taken recently to **start talking about things** - what I'm up to, doing, want to talk about, would have wanted to be asked about"

**Result**: "Then conversation proceeds normally, interested, back and forth - but **initiation, asking questions about somebody else, noticing it in its absence**"

**Personal example - 55-year-old friend**:
- Woman they've known **since she was 12, now ~55**
- Dinner few months ago, **spent 3 hours together**, lovely buffet, backyard
- **Didn't ask a single question of us** - not "How are you doing? How's your life? How's your health?"
- Knows Jane has been going through **major health issues for many years**
- Gil became **increasingly uncomfortable**, really baffled
- **Didn't figure out what was weird until afterwards**
- Never been in situation like that
- **Significance**: "Challenges my assumption that it's a phenomenon of younger people - **she's not young**"

**Old data point**: Early on in Natural Logic, doing site assessments of companies looking at efficiency... (cuts off in excerpt)

**Significance**: Gil's discomfort with one-way conversations is profound - not just intellectual observation but emotional experience. Questions whether it's generational (she's 55) or personality (Big Five Openness?).

### Victoria: Linking Curiosity to OGM Themes

**Curiosity as organizing principle**

**Victoria's connections**:
- Issue of **access** links to books as **"fossil knowledge"** (trapped)
- **Silos**
- Academia **paid subscriptions**
- A lot of things going on

**Proposal**: "Gather everything and start thinking how this **relates to different OGM projects**, or different things that can start from here"

**Significance**: Victoria seeing curiosity as thread connecting multiple OGM themes - access, silos, knowledge democratization. Echoes Doug's Call 14 insight about OGM as gravitational center connecting projects.

---

## Excalidraw Themes

**Description**: Victoria created collaborative board exploring curiosity

**Approach**: Hand-drawn aesthetic, multi-user, **questions rather than answers**

**Themes explored**:
- Education
- Access to knowledge
- Silos
- **Fossil knowledge** (books)
- Academia paywalls

**Method**: **Open questions to generate possibilities, not close down with solutions**

**Significance**: Visual collaborative thinking tool - learning from past definitional spirals (Calls 05, 07).

---

## Questions Raised

- What happened to curiosity?
- Are we losing curiosity or is it being diminished?
- **Does education close curiosity?**
- Why do some people not ask questions in conversations?
- Is lack of curiosity a generational phenomenon or personality trait?
- How does the Big Five Openness dimension relate to curiosity?
- What is the relationship between access to knowledge and curiosity?
- How do silos and paywalls affect curiosity?
- What is **"fossil knowledge"** and how does it trap information?

---

## Participation Notes

**Victoria (Spain)**: Created Excalidraw board, framing as **questions not solutions**, linking curiosity to access/silos themes, ongoing concern, **fossil knowledge concept**

**Kevin Jones**: **Completely disagrees with premise** curiosity being diminished

**Jerry Michalski**: Facilitator, noted **selection bias** (OGM is all curious people), original question about kids in school

**Scott Moehring**: **Big Five Openness dimension** explanation, spectrum, evolutionary neutrality, OGM high in openness

**Gil Friend**: **One-way conversations observation**, younger people not asking questions, **55-year-old friend example** (3 hours, zero questions), new strategy of volunteering information

---

## Emotional Tone

Exploratory, disagreement acknowledged (Kevin), discomfort (Gil's one-way conversations), curious about curiosity itself, collaborative (Excalidraw).
