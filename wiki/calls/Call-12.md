# Call 12: Has Progress Stopped?

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Type**: Topical discussion
**Duration**: ~90 minutes (estimate)
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

---

## Quick Summary

Jerry posed the provocative question: "Has progress stopped?" The conversation immediately fragmented on **what progress even means** (Mike: "we'll talk past each other"). **Alex led with vested interests framework** - hegemonic forces suppress disruptive innovation (anticipated pushback: "You're a conspiracy theorist, Alex"). **Gil challenged the definition** ("What IS progress?") with personal examples (wife's cancer remission, rooftop solar). **Mike reframed** to "Are there more barriers to technological development?" and introduced **"cosplay diplomacy"** concept. Victoria in chat also asked "what is progress?" The call illustrated its own problem - can't answer whether progress stopped without agreeing what progress is.

## Key Themes

### Alex: Vested Interests Suppress Progress

**Core argument**

**Alex Kladitis**:
- **Big interests now work AGAINST progress** - exception is computing/IT
- **Example**: Best battery ever invented tomorrow? Oil industry + governments would say "too much economic impact" and **buy it out**
- **Hegemonic interests** in world economy suppressing massive disruptive progress
- Anticipated pushback: **"You're a conspiracy theorist, Alex"** - but thinks this is part of the cycle

**Jerry's confirmation**: "Vested interests kill golden goose progress"

**Historical example - Great American Streetcar Conspiracy**:
- GM, Firestone, Phillips66, Mack Truck **bought light rail lines**
- Turned down service, shut down lines, **pulled up rails, burned cars**
- Result: Car culture, not public transit
- Found guilty of antitrust but **too late**

**Significance**: Not conspiracy theory - documented historical pattern. Corporate power actively suppresses disruptive innovation.

### Gil: "What IS Progress?"

**Question behind the question**

**Gil's challenge**: "What IS progress?"

**Victoria in chat**: Also asked "what is progress?"

**Gil's examples of progress**:

**Energy transition**:
- Renewable > coal globally now
- Striking price/performance progress over 20-30 years

**Medical**:
- Wife **11 years in remission** from disease that would've killed her in 2 years
- Cancer research progress

**Personal**:
- Induction range, rooftop solar, backup battery switching in microseconds
- **Better experience, same electrons**
- Behind curtain matters too

**Gil's challenge to universal narrative**: US lack of progress vs European cities shows **progress may be highly localized**, not about humanity overall

**Significance**: Progress isn't monolithic - different dimensions, different locations, different time scales.

---

### Mike: Narrowing the Question

**"Provocative and obnoxious" reframing**

**Mike's proposal**: "Rewrite the question - we've been diverted 10 minutes defining progress, **not useful**, all have different definitions (Mike has 5+)"

**Narrowed question**: **"Are there more barriers to technological development than in the past?"**

**Mike's progress dimensions**:
1. Scientific/research discoveries
2. Applying discoveries in cool new technologies
3. Economic barriers preventing use (super battery example)
4. Building societies in better ways (societal progress, governance evolution)

**Mike's warning**: "Question so broad we'll all talk past each other - each person different place of what progress is most important"

**Alternate framing**: "Quality of daily life improvement over 200 years plateauing or ceasing?"

**Mike's view**: Would argue against globally, but **US quality of life not doing well** - "amusing ourselves to death," conflicting demands, **Confusopoly** (Dilbert term)

**Confusopoly**: Companies throwing so many options, constantly confusing what product is and how much we pay - **no time to sort through crap**

**Significance**: Mike trying to save conversation from definitional spiral (echoing Calls 05, 07, 08). Meta-awareness of group's definitional pattern.

---

### Jerry: Progress as Transformation of Daily Life

**Superficial metric**

**Jerry's examples**:
- **Electrification** (grandparents)
- **Hygiene revolution** (great-grandparents) - outhouse → running clean water
- Supersonic travel would be perceived (vs renewable energy behind curtain)
- **AI might be next large transformation** happening right now

**Jerry's skepticism**: "Don't particularly want urban airscapes littered with drones/air taxis - **fender bender ignorable, quadcopter crash not**"

**"Where is my flying car?"**: Expected hexacopter Uber by now - but maybe that's not real progress

**Progress might be relentment**: "Maybe real progress is NOT pushing addictive technology on us - **progress might be entirely different**"

**Significance**: Jerry open to redefining progress itself - maybe not about dramatic visible change but about restraint, sustainability, well-being.

---

### Customer Service Enshittification

**Mike Nelson's observation**

**Observation**: Companies won't answer phone when you call them

**AI impact**: Despite new AI tools, call centers doing **BETTER job of diverting away from end goal** than getting there

**Book recommendations**:

**"Enshittification"** by Cory Doctorow:
- Why can't we have good things?
- Why aren't tech breakthroughs leading to customer service + quality of life improvements?

**"Breakneck"**: Subtitle says it all (deeper and more important - Mike didn't finish describing)

**Significance**: Technology advancement (AI) making customer experience WORSE, not better. Paradox of progress.

## Questions Raised

- Has progress stopped?
- What is progress?
- Are there more barriers to technological development than in the past?
- Why do vested interests suppress disruptive progress?
- Is progress transformation of daily life, or deeper systemic change?
- Why aren't technological breakthroughs leading to quality of life improvements?
- Is progress localized (Europe vs US) rather than global?
- Where is my flying car?
- Is AI the next large transformation we're living through?
- Is real progress restraint rather than expansion?

---

## Books and Resources

### Book

**"Enshittification"** by Cory Doctorow (Mike Nelson) - Why can't we have good things? Why tech breakthroughs don't lead to quality improvements

**"Breakneck"** (Mike Nelson) - Deeper and more important book (subtitle not fully described in excerpt)

### Concept

**Great American Streetcar Conspiracy** (Jerry Michalski) - GM, Firestone, Phillips66, Mack Truck killed public transit to sell buses, found guilty of antitrust but too late

**Confusopoly** - Dilbert (Scott Adams) concept (Mike Nelson) - Companies confuse what product is and pricing to prevent comparison

---

## Participation Notes

**Jerry Michalski**: Facilitator, raised topic, open to multiple definitions, skeptical of flying cars, **progress might be relentment**

**Alex Kladitis**: Led with **vested interests suppression**, hegemonic interests, anticipated conspiracy theory pushback

**Gil Friend**: **Challenged definition**, brought renewable energy data, personal medical example (wife's cancer), rooftop solar, localized progress

**Mike Nelson**: Provocative reframing, narrowing to technological barriers, **Enshittification book rec**, Confusopoly concept

**Victoria**: Asked in chat "what is progress?"

---

## Emotional Tone

Provocative (Mike self-describes), definitional wrestling, skepticism about mainstream progress narrative. Less heavy than trauma calls, more analytical.

---

## Special Notes

- **Call explicitly about meta-question**: Has progress stopped?
- **Group immediately fragments on definition of progress** (Mike: we'll talk past each other)
- Alex brings **vested interests framework** from start - anticipates being called conspiracy theorist
- Gil brings **personal (wife's cancer), local (rooftop solar), global (renewable energy)** examples - multi-scale
- Mike tries to narrow to something specific (**technological barriers**)
- Jerry open to **"progress might be relentment on addictive tech"** - skeptical of tech progress
- **Enshittification theme continues from Call 10** (Gil's question about monetization)
- **Customer service degradation despite AI** - ironic
- **Europe vs US progress localization** - challenges universal narrative
- Definitional pattern continues (Calls 05, 07, 08, 09, now 12)

## Cross-Call Connections

### Backward Connections

- **Call 10** - Enshittification (Gil's question about monetization) → Call 12 Mike's focus
- **Call 05, 07, 08, 09** - Definition debates continue → "what is progress?"
- **Call 11** - Kevin's Mennonite miracle = actual progress in Swannanoa

### Forward Connections

- **Call 13** - Crony Capitalism will develop vested interests theme further
- **Call 14** - AI bubble - is that progress or bubble?

### Thematic Connections

**Completes Batch 4: Interrogating** (Calls 10-12)

Call 12 interrogates progress itself. Pattern: AI as participant (Call 10) → Worldviews (Call 11) → Progress definitions (Call 12). Technology and beliefs both questioned.

---

## Batch Context

**Batch 4 (Calls 10-12): Interrogating**

Technology interrogation escalates from practical to existential. Call 12 questions whether progress exists at all. Kevin Jones arc reached PEAK in Call 11; Call 12 questions larger narratives.
