# Call 03: Information Trust and Disinformation

**Date**: August 14, 2025
**Type**: Hybrid (brief personal updates + topical discussion)
**Duration**: ~105 minutes
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

---

## Quick Summary

Jerry returns from Italy to tackle the crisis of information trust in an age of disinformation. The call explored how we know which information to trust when multiple credible sources contradict each other (Gil's Gaza paradox), why there's a business model for spreading disinformation but not for fighting it (Mike's insight), and whether "brain defense" is better framing than "media literacy." The group examined everything from misattributed quotes to the death of journalism, with the East Germany trust paradox offering unexpected wisdom.

## Key Themes

### Information Trust Paradox

**How we know what information to trust in the torrent**

**Jerry's framing**:
- Trust is fragile but solid
- Happens in quirky places
- Forwarding info to group = putting reputation behind it
- Under pressure, deepest trust emerges

**East Germany paradox** (Jerry's story):
- DDR had 1-in-10 informants (Stasi surveillance state)
- **Low surface trust** everywhere - couldn't trust neighbors
- **Underground networks had incredibly high trust** because lives were on the line
- People will never experience trust that deep again
- Paradox: Oppression created both extreme mistrust AND extreme trust simultaneously

**Pattern**: Trust emerges strongest when stakes are highest.

**Application to current era**: Do we need crisis-level stakes to develop reliable trust networks?

---

### Gaza Information War

**Gil Friend's impossible situation**

**The problem**: Multiple **credible** sources contradict each other about Gaza/Israel conflict

**Examples**:
- Israeli sources vs Palestinian sources
- International observers vs regional reporters
- Official statements vs leaked documents

**Key insights**:
- Israel blocking foreign journalists from Gaza
- Israeli public has limited news access about Gaza situation
- Rising anti-war sentiment in Israel (not widely reported)
- Even with discernment, **can't figure out 'what's so'**

**Gil's frustration**: "I can't figure out what's actually happening, even when I apply all my critical thinking and source evaluation."

**Significance**: If intelligent, well-informed people with good epistemology can't determine truth, what hope for general population?

---

### Disinformation Mechanics

**Mike Nelson's expertise on how false information spreads**

**Examples**:

**Misattributed quotes epidemic**:
- Mike found "perfect quote" from Marcus Aurelius: "Far better to be rejected by society than subsumed by a mob of idiots"
- Turned out **Leo Tolstoy made it up** and attributed it to Marcus Aurelius
- Happens constantly - see Quote Investigator for corrections

**Elon Musk-Baltimore Ravens story**:
- $500M sponsorship offer spread widely in last 24 hours
- **Completely made up** but plausible
- Shows how false but believable stories spread rapidly

**The asymmetry problem**:
- **11 ways to fight disinformation** (Alicia Wanless / Carnegie project)
- **None work really well**
- **No business model** for fighting disinformation
- **Strong business model** for spreading it
- Lies move fast, truth corrects slowly

**Mike's insight**: Should focus on **amplifiers/forwarders**, not just sources. People resharing false info often don't know it's false.

---

### Brain Defense vs Media Literacy

**Mike Nelson's reframing**

**Problem with "media literacy"**:
- Sounds educational, abstract
- Doesn't capture urgency
- Misses emotional dimension

**Better framing: "Brain Defense"**:
- Defending against hateful, ignorant, deceitful memes
- Protecting yourself from bumper sticker simplifications
- Active defense posture, not passive literacy

**Group resonance**: Term immediately clicked with participants as more accurate framing.

**Significance**: Language matters - "brain defense" conveys stakes and agency better than "media literacy."

---

### Death of Journalism

**Jerry's observation**

The "protracted, agonizing death of journalism" is well underway.

**Questions this raises**:
- What replaces journalism?
- People always need information even in terrible situations
- Local news especially devastated
- Investigative journalism economically unsustainable
- Substack/newsletter model doesn't replace institutional journalism

**Unresolved**: No one has figured out what comes after journalism dies.

---

### Electronic Graffiti Vision

**Failed business model from 20 years ago**

**Concept**: Singapore company created app allowing annotations/corrections on any website visible to other app users

**Goal**: Crowdsourced fact-checking and context

**Problem**: Never got business model, never worked at scale

**Why it failed**:
- Network effects problem - needed critical mass
- No monetization path
- Privacy concerns
- Website owners resistant

**Significance**: Good ideas for fighting disinformation often lack viable business models.

## Stories Shared

### Jerry: East Germany Trust Paradox

**Summary**: DDR had 1-in-10 informants (Stasi), creating low surface trust. But underground networks had incredibly high trust because lives were on the line. People will never experience trust that deep again.

**Impact**: Reframes how we think about trust - emerges strongest under pressure, can coexist with widespread mistrust.

### Mike: Misattributed Marcus Aurelius Quote

**Summary**: Found perfect quote: "Far better to be rejected by society than subsumed by a mob of idiots." Turned out Leo Tolstoy made it up and attributed it to Marcus Aurelius.

**Impact**: Example of quote attribution problem happening constantly.

### Mike: Elon Musk-Baltimore Ravens Fake Story

**Summary**: $500M sponsorship offer story spread widely in last 24 hours - completely made up but plausible.

**Impact**: Shows how false but plausible stories spread rapidly before debunking catches up.

### Gil: Laptop Protein Drink Incident

**Summary**: Learned not to pour protein drink on laptop, now working from iPad which is "not too bad."

**Impact**: Light moment - "iPad: not too bad" as tagline. Also: Gil's concussion recovery starts here (continues in Call 06).

## Cross-Call Connections

### Backward Connections

- **Call 01** - German war guilt and trust issues → Call 03 East Germany trust paradox
- **Call 02** - Community coordination failure → Information coordination failure
- **Call 02** - Mike's digital leadership → Mike's disinformation expertise

### Forward Connections

- **Call 04** - Reality melting - if trust fails (Call 03), reality itself dissolves (Call 04)
- **Call 05** - Sense-making challenges - how to make sense when can't trust information?
- **Call 10** - AI as conversation participant - might AI help with information filtering?

### Thematic Connections

**Completes Batch 1: Grounding** (Calls 01-03)

Pattern across Batch 1:
- Call 01: Societal trauma processing (theoretical)
- Call 02: Personal trauma (Kevin's lived experience)
- Call 03: Information trauma (can't trust sources)

Grounding phase establishes crisis across multiple levels: personal, social, epistemological.

---

## Batch Context

**Batch 1 (Calls 01-03): Grounding**

Call 03 completes the grounding phase by establishing **information trust crisis** as third pillar alongside personal trauma (Kevin) and societal grief (Call 01). The batch establishes baseline: We're operating in environment of compounding crises at multiple scales.
