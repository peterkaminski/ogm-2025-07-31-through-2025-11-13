# Call 08: Abundance

**Date**: September 26, 2025
**Type**: Topical discussion with speed round
**Duration**: ~97 minutes
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski
**Format**: Stacey Druss's speed round exercise

---

## Quick Summary

Learning from the extended definition debates in Calls 05 and 07, **Stacey Druss proposed a "speed round" format** - quick definitions only, no explaining initially. The group delivered beautifully pithy responses ranging from Jewish wisdom ("Content with their lot" - Gil) to Japanese ikigai (Jessie) to spiritual peace (Klaus) to infinite possibility (Doug). Jerry's "more than enough" was self-described as "slightly controversial," suggesting tension between sufficiency and surplus views of abundance. The format worked - focused, efficient, diverse perspectives captured quickly.

---

## Speed Round Definitions

**Format proposed by Stacey Druss**: Quick title/phrase/headline/bumper sticker - what abundance IS only

**Definitions captured**:

1. **Stacey Druss**: "Having what you need when you need it"
2. **Gil Friend**: "Content with their lot" (Pirkei Avot - Jewish wisdom: "Who is rich? The person who is content with their lot")
3. **Jessie Upp**: "Ikigai" (overlap of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, what you can get paid for)
4. **Alex Kladitis**: "Pass"
5. **Pete Kaminski**: "Love is all you need" (Beatles reference, oblique contribution)
6. **Klaus Mager**: "To be at peace with the gifts you have been given"
7. **Doug Breitbart**: "Infinite possibility"
8. **Jerry Michalski**: "More than enough" (self-described as "slightly controversial")
9. **John Warinner**: "More than enough" (agreed with Jerry's framing)
10. **Rick Botelho**: "Co-intelligence"

---

## Thematic Clusters

### Sufficiency

**Definitions**: "Having what you need when you need it," "More than enough," "Content with their lot"

**Theme**: Enough-ness as abundance - not excess but adequacy or slightly more

**Tension**: Jerry's "more than enough" described as controversial - implies abundance requires surplus? Others focused on sufficiency or contentment.

---

### Inner State

**Definitions**: "Content with their lot," "At peace with gifts given," "Love is all you need"

**Theme**: Abundance as internal state of being, not external having

**Wisdom traditions**: Jewish tradition (Gil), spiritual peace (Klaus), Beatles wisdom (Pete)

---

### Alignment

**Definitions**: "Ikigai," "Co-intelligence"

**Theme**: Abundance as being in right relationship - with self, world, others

---

### Expansiveness

**Definition**: "Infinite possibility"

**Theme**: Abundance as unlimited potential (Doug's expansive view)

---

## Key Themes

### Stacey's Format Innovation

**Learning from Calls 05 and 07**

**The problem**: Extended definition debates (sense-making Call 05, collaboration Call 07) consumed entire calls without resolution.

**Stacey's solution**:
- Speed round before usual conversation rounds
- Quick phrase/title/headline/bumper sticker only
- What it IS (not how/where/when/why)
- Can say "pass"
- Refrain from explaining initially

**Result**: "Pithy and right on mission" - Jerry surprised how early in call everyone was focused.

**Significance**: Format innovation prevents extended debate, gets diverse views on table quickly. Group learning from its own patterns.

---

### Ikigai Returns

**Jessie Upp's framework (from Call 02)**

**Elements**:
- What you love
- What you're good at
- What the world needs
- What you can be paid for

**Abundance**: Living at intersection of all four

**Callback**: Jessie introduced ikigai in Call 02 for DayBalancer matching. Now returns as her abundance definition - consistency in her thinking.

---

### Gil's Jewish Wisdom

**Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the Fathers)**

**Question**: "Who is rich?"

**Answer**: "The person who is content with their lot"

**Implication**: Abundance is contentment, not accumulation

**Perfect alignment**: Gil's definition perfectly suited to abundance topic - spiritual wisdom tradition.

---

### Jerry's "Slightly Controversial" Surplus

**"More than enough"**

Jerry described his own definition as "slightly controversial" - suggests he anticipated pushback.

**Why controversial?**:
- Implies abundance requires **surplus**, not just sufficiency
- Others focused on contentment, peace, adequacy
- "More than enough" suggests growth, expansion beyond needs

**Significance**: Reveals underlying tension - is abundance internal contentment or external surplus?

---

### Alex Passing

**Pattern continuation**

Alex passed on the speed round exercise.

**Context**:
- Call 05: Alex felt lost without objective, solution-oriented
- Call 08: Passed on definitional exercise

**Consistency**: Alex's solution-orientation means definitional/process exercises don't engage him. Not disengaged from OGM, but selective about what resonates.

---

## Contextual Notes

### Stacey's Email

**Proposal**: Speed round before usual conversation rounds

**Closing**: "Thank you for attention to this matter" with wink

**Parallel**: Mocking Trump Truth Social posts ending with same phrase - political context bleeding into calls.

---

### Gil's Withdrawal

**Before call started**: Gil discussing Zoom assistant addiction and Facebook withdrawal

**Jerry's reference**: French Connection 2 - Popeye Doyle heroin addiction and cold turkey withdrawal

**Theme**: Digital addiction as modern abundance problem? We have abundance of connection, information, stimulation - addiction follows.

---

### Alex's Power Cuts

**Context**: UK power cuts, new substation improvements not working

**Alex's commentary**: "They spent money, economy worked, people got shares, system kicks on, moves on"

**Tone**: Cynical about infrastructure spending - connects to Call 12 progress questions.

---

## Frameworks Introduced

### Ikigai

**Source**: Japanese concept
**Shared by**: Jessie Upp

**Elements**:
- What you love
- What you're good at
- What the world needs
- What you can be paid for

**Abundance**: Living at intersection of all four

---

### Pirkei Avot

**Source**: Jewish wisdom - Ethics of the Fathers
**Shared by**: Gil Friend

**Question**: "Who is rich?"
**Answer**: "The person who is content with their lot"

**Gil Friend**: Jewish wisdom contribution, recovering from Facebook withdrawal

**Jessie Upp**: Ikigai framework - recall from Call 02 DayBalancer project, consistency

**Jerry Michalski**: "More than enough" described as controversial - suggests abundance requires surplus

**Klaus Mager**: Spiritual/peace framing - "at peace with gifts given"

**Doug Breitbart**: Expansive view - "infinite possibility"

**Rick Botelho**: "Co-intelligence" - social/collective dimension

**Alex Kladitis**: Passed on exercise (consistent with Call 05 pattern)

**Pete Kaminski**: Beatles wisdom, oblique contribution

---

## Emotional Tone

Lighthearted opening (withdrawal jokes, power cuts), focused speed round, efficient and pithy. Less heavy than previous calls, more playful.

---

## Special Notes

- **Stacey's speed round format worked well** - people were "pithy and right on mission"
- Jerry surprised how early in call everyone was so focused
- **Ikigai returns from Call 02** (Jessie Upp's framework) - shows consistency
- **Gil's Jewish wisdom perfectly aligned** with abundance theme
- **Jerry's "more than enough" as controversial** suggests group tension about what abundance means
- **Alex passed** - consistent with Call 05 solution-orientation, may not engage with definitional exercises
- **Multiple spiritual/wisdom traditions** invoked (Jewish, Japanese, Beatles)
- **Trump Truth Social reference** shows political context bleeding into calls
- **Kevin Jones ABSENT** (2nd of 3-call absence, Batch 3)

---

## Cross-Call Connections

### Backward Connections

- **Call 02** - Jessie Upp's ikigai from DayBalancer project returns as abundance definition
- **Call 05** - Alex passing on exercise consistent with solution-orientation (lost in process)
- **Call 06** - Klaus's peace/gifts theme connects to his regenerative food pivot
- **Call 07** - Definition exercise after collaboration definition debate - **format learning**

### Forward Connections

- **Call 09** - OGM meta-discussion, definitional patterns continue
- **Call 11** - Kevin returns with abundance (Mennonite miracle) - actual experience of "more than enough"

### Thematic Connections

**Part of Batch 3: Foundations** (Calls 07-09)

Call 08 continues definitional exploration but with **improved format** (speed round). Pattern: Collaboration definitions (Call 07) → Abundance definitions (Call 08) → OGM purpose definitions (Call 09).

---

## Batch Context

**Batch 3 (Calls 07-09): Foundations**

Call 08 shows **methodological learning** - Stacey's speed round prevents extended debate seen in Calls 05 and 07. Group improving its own processes while exploring foundational concepts.

**Note**: Kevin Jones **ABSENT** (2nd of 3 calls). Will return minimally Call 10, triumphantly Call 11 with actual abundance (Mennonite miracle).
