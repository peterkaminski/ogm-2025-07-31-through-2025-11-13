**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Type**: Hybrid (topical discussion + check-ins)
**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

## Quick Summary

This call explored how we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview, using examples from Trump's Middle East diplomacy to a Carnegie scholar caught with classified documents. But the call is most memorable for **Kevin Jones's extraordinary return** after being absent for three calls, bringing news of a MIRACLE: 25 old-order Mennonite carpenters are coming to build 20 houses in Swannanoa for FREE. This represents the peak of Kevin's story arc from crisis (Call 01) through despair (Call 02) to unexpected abundance.

## Key Themes

### Kevin's Mennonite MIRACLE ⭐

**The most important moment in this call and a peak in Kevin's story arc**

**The News** (Kevin Jones, returning after 3-call absence):

1. **25 old-order Mennonite carpenters** are coming to Swannanoa
2. Will **build ~20 houses for FREE** (November through May, possibly repeat next year)
3. Living on Kevin's farm, self-contained with trucks and tools
4. Will **rehab Kevin's house for free** (sheetrock, insulation, etc.)
5. Leave behind a 30x40 foot building (their mess hall)
6. **Context**: 1 in 6 houses in the low-status neighborhood destroyed/uninhabitable (~400 houses)
7. Starting housing fund for Latino families (who moved there because it was cheapest in county)
8. **Impact**: Labor on 20 houses no longer in fundraising math - **massive cost savings**

**Kevin's tone**: "Amazingly, surprisingly good. Sometimes there are days like that."

**Kevin's philosophy story**: College trip with his son - upgraded to first class, hotel closed but Samoan guy let them stay free, sampled single malts from bar, movie theater stopped taking tickets. "Sometimes there are days like this."

**Challenge ahead**: Stitching together all these new resources will be really complicated - needs people better at coordination.

**Gil's question**: "Why is that a challenge to your worldview?"

**Kevin's answer**: "It doesn't challenge worldview - it challenges the call topic (focus on bad things). Sometimes think about good things too. Surprising abundance requires lots of coordination."

### Kevin Jones Story Arc: PEAK MOMENT

**Call 01** (July 31): Fled to Europe after Hurricane Helene devastation of Swannanoa
**Call 02** (Aug 7): "Throat level sadness," moving to Asheville, giving up on Swannanoa
**Call 06** (Sep 4): Finding role helping Swannanoa recovery without being in sadness
**Calls 07-09**: ABSENT entire Batch 3
**Call 10** (Oct 9): Returned, minimal participation
**Call 11** (Oct 16): 🎉 **BACK WITH AMAZING NEWS** - Mennonite miracle

**Trajectory**: Crisis → Despair → Finding purpose → Absence (processing?) → MIRACLE

**Significance**: From personal trauma victim to community recovery leader with unexpected abundance of help. This represents a complete transformation documented in real-time across 11 calls.

**About old-order Mennonites**: Wear straw hats, use horse-drawn things, but also use power tools and semi-trailers. Traditional but pragmatic.

### Worldview Challenges

**How do we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview?**

**Jerry's framing**: "We're a left-leaning group. How do we process Trump achieving a Gaza ceasefire and making progress in Venezuela? How do we handle news conflicting with our worldview?"

**Examples of uncomfortable news**:
- Trump Gaza ceasefire: all October 7 hostages resolved
- Maria Corina Machado (Nobel Peace Prize winner) dedicated award to "the people of Venezuela and President Trump"
- Trump sent Navy offshore Venezuela, $40M bounty on Maduro, "moving the needle"
- Mike Nelson's favorite colleague: top Carnegie scholar caught with 1000+ classified documents

**Gil's response**: "Cautiously impressed with Trump Middle East work, but don't give Peace Prize for just starting initiatives. This challenges my picture of 'bumbling, narcissistic baby guy' - doesn't mean he can't do some things successfully. One thing's moved over. Maybe."

**Mike's response**: "'Cosplay diplomacy' - temporary deals without substance, like the Afghanistan withdrawal setup"

---

### Cosplay Diplomacy

**Mike Nelson's critique of Trump's diplomatic claims**

**Concept**: Claims of stopping wars are temporary, lack substance, "cosplay" rather than real diplomacy

**Examples**:
- **Armenia-Azerbaijan**: Temporary, not meaningful reconciliation
- **Gaza**: "Deal" in NYC real estate sense (common goal, figure out details later), already falling apart. Hamas explicitly said they didn't agree to disarm part of "deal"
- **Afghanistan parallel**: Trump talked to Taliban, not Afghan government. Vague deal with no checks. Timed withdrawal after he left office - Biden got "egg on his face" from incompetent deal.

**Mike's warning**: "Let's wait 5 years and look back. No diplomat would claim what Hamas half-agreed to is a final deal. Gaza deal may fail like Afghanistan."

---

### Carnegie Scholar Shock

**Mike's personal worldview challenge**

**The news** (two days before call): One of Carnegie's top analysts (Indian military/geopolitics expert) - house raided by FBI, found **1000+ top-secret/confidential documents**

**Context**:
- Mike's favorite colleague
- Advisor to State Department
- Knows how to handle classified docs
- Stories emerging: is he a spy for China? (not accused yet)
- Similar to Sandy Berger (Clinton's National Security Advisor) stuffing docs in pants, but **much larger scale**

**Mike's reaction**: "Completely disconnect from everything I know about this scholar, makes no sense. Having very hard time dealing with it. Don't know how I will."

**Jerry's response**: "Perfect example of ill-fitting news in our worldview. Do we allow our worldviews to be permeable to things like that?"

**Significance**: This isn't just political - Mike is personally experiencing cognitive dissonance about someone he knows and respects.

---

### Left-Right Narrative Divide

**Al Chang's insight** (Jerry's friend):

1. There's a set of facts on the ground
2. Left and right see roughly the same facts
3. But have **completely different movie scripts/narratives** around them
4. Both narratives are relatively consistent and work
5. Two sides **can't see or read each other's narratives** - incapable

**Jerry's question**: "How do I steel man the opposing narrative? How do I put my brain into it and listen for different parts?"

**Jerry's method**: Asked Claude and ChatGPT: "What has Trump actually done?" Discovered his people have been on the ground doing stuff that hasn't been done before in multiple places.

**Pattern**: Same facts, different interpretive frameworks, mutual incomprehension.

---

### Machado's Nobel Dedication

**Venezuelan opposition leader dedicates Nobel Peace Prize to Trump**

**Maria Corina Machado**: "I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!"

**The Nation's reaction**: Article calling it "sellout, terrible"

**Backstory**: Trump only president who actually sent Navy offshore, did stuff helpful against Maduro, $40M bounty on Maduro's head (legality questionable)

**Mike's alternate reading**: "She's in a bind. Has to be as obsequious as possible." Someone angry he doesn't have Peace Prize, she needs his help. Do words reflect what she really believes?

**Pattern**: Same action (dedication), completely different interpretations.

---

## Emerging Patterns

1. **Kevin Jones trajectory**: Deteriorating → Finding role → Absent → Returns with MIRACLE (Mennonites)
2. **Worldview permeability question**: How rigid vs flexible are our frameworks?
3. **Good news requires coordination too**: Kevin - surprising abundance needs stitching together
4. **Left-right narrative divide**: Same facts, different movies
5. **Temporary vs lasting change**: Cosplay diplomacy vs real peace

---

## Questions Raised

- How do we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview?
- Do we allow our worldviews to be permeable?
- How do we steel man opposing narratives?
- Is Trump's diplomacy real or cosplay?
- Will Gaza deal last or fail like Afghanistan?
- How does someone so smart do something so stupid? (Mike's colleague)
- When does surprising abundance become a coordination challenge?
- How do we see each other's narratives across left-right divide?

---

## Participation Notes

**Jerry Michalski**: Facilitator, wrestling with Trump's actual achievements vs worldview, shared Al Chang's parallel narratives insight, actively using AI (Claude, ChatGPT) to steel man opposing views

**Gil Friend**: Cautiously impressed with Trump Middle East work, pushed back on premature Peace Prize, challenged Kevin on why good news is worldview challenge. Models healthy worldview update: "cautiously impressed... one thing's moved over. Maybe."

**Mike Nelson**: Introduced "cosplay diplomacy" concept, drew Afghanistan parallel, shared Carnegie colleague scandal (personal worldview shock), provided foreign policy expertise

**Kevin Jones**: 🌟 **MAJOR NEWS** - Mennonite carpenters miracle! Absent Calls 07-09, minimal Call 10, now back with amazing story. Also shared "sometimes there are days like this" abundance philosophy.
