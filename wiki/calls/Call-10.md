# Call 10: AI as Conversation Participant - Tools and Understanding

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Type**: Meta-discussion continuation / Salon
**Duration**: ~90 minutes (estimate)
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

---

## Quick Summary

Continuing Call 09's meta-reflection, this call featured **John Warinner's epiphany**: "Why aren't LLMs just participants in THIS conversation?" Instead of sharing loquacious AI chat transcripts, why not bring AI into the room? The group explored Gene Bellinger's wisdom ("the mapping, not the map"), Jerry's pi.ai "best interview ever," and Shawn Murphy's Thinkertoys demo (collaborative knowledge tool with AI). **Kevin Jones returned** after 3-call absence with minimal participation. The call wrestled with enshittification, privacy paradoxes, and Jerry's frustrated desire: "I'd really like to build a global mind... We really haven't done that. We haven't done much of that at all."

## Key Themes

### John's Epiphany: AI as Group Participant

**THE transformative insight**

**John Warinner's problem**:
- Everyone having revealing one-on-one AI explorations
- Want to share, but bombarding each other with **loquacious exchanges** (2,000-4,000 words)
- **Bandwidth problem**: Can't digest everyone's long transcripts

**John's light bulb**:
**"Why aren't LLMs just participants in THIS conversation?"**

- Asked ChatGPT: How far off?
- Response: **Couple years away, in the pipeline**
- Would be a different chapter than current one-on-one era
- Might temper frustration of trying to share everything

**Impact**: Reframes problem from "how do we share AI conversations?" to **"why aren't AIs here with us?"**

**Significance**: This insight becomes increasingly relevant as calls progress - AI not as tool but as participant.

---

### Gene Bellinger: The Mapping, Not the Map

**John Warinner + Jerry + Doug**

**Gene Bellinger's wisdom**: **"The value is the gerund - it's the mapping, not the map"**

**John's application**: "Greatest value is in the conversation, not the product of the conversation"

**Jerry's experience**:
- Other people's maps often **impenetrable** unless unpacked slowly
- Gene Bellinger builds maps piece by piece - takes effort on both sides
- **Small percentage** can navigate Jerry's Brain solo
- Tier needs **guidance from Jerry**
- Few deeply understand **WHY** he curated specific contexts

**Doug's extension**:
- It's not JUST the exercise of mapping
- Gene's maps **create models**, reflect living systems
- **Reveal complex systems, identify leverage points**
- Inform next action, where to focus intervention or contribution

**Significance**: Maps (artifacts) vs mapping (process) tension. Same as Call 09 salon (process) vs bodies of work (artifacts) tension.

### Jerry's Pi.ai Best Interview Ever

**Transformative AI conversation experience**

**What happened** (couple years ago):
- Pi.ai said "what's on your mind?"
- **90 minutes later**: Best interview ever
- Kept saying **"it sounds like you said this, do you mean this?"**
- **Raised the conversation**
- Not Eliza, not stochastic parrot - **deeply understanding**
- "Oh my god, oh my god!" - shook him a little bit

**Result**: Hasn't gone back to that thread. Trying to figure out how to incorporate AI into life more.

**Significance**: AI as excellent conversational partner - not just answer machine but **active listener who elevates dialogue**. Prefigures Jerry's psilocybin journey (Call 14) in transformative experiences.

---

### Why Are We Here? (Purpose Question)

**Alex asked explicitly, others responded**

**Alex Kladitis's purpose**:
"Hear new perspectives or existing perspectives from different people with different viewpoint. **Makes me think.**"

**Jerry Michalski's purposes**:
- Learn stuff I would never figure out - people share what they're finding/thinking
- **"I hadn't put that plus that together in my head"** - curation over time gets better, knowledge accumulates
- Love who shows up, social interactions
- Love that we know what we do - **4-5 years of history**, not "what do you do?"
- **Bringing people together who then go off** and have conversations, do projects
- "If three people met and did something they loved, **that's gold**"
- **Frustrated desire**: "I'd really like to build a global mind... **We really haven't done that. We haven't done much of that at all.**"

**Doug Breitbart's purpose**:
- **Understanding** - not agreement, just common understanding
- Get on same page at most simple, basic, fundamental **semantic level**
- My meaning and somebody else's meaning is aligned, recognized, understood
- **Helping with decision-making**
- Better decisions, contribute positively, minimize destruction
- **LLMs enable handling complex array of variables in real-time** like never before

**Jerry's alignment**: "We're on the same mission - helping people make better decisions, achieve mutual understanding despite stumbling blocks like language and technology."

**Significance**: Explicit articulation of OGM purposes - learning, connecting, decision-making. Jerry's frustrated global mind vision contrasts with Call 09 "lovely salons" acceptance.

### Enshittification and Monetization

**Can platforms sustain without falling into enshittification?**

**Stacey's observation**:
- Facebook developed "for them" (students) initially
- **Negatives came when monetization came in**
- Don't throw out positive (creating for community) with negative (monetization)

**Jerry's correction**: "Facebook birth story actually **Face Smash to rate 'hot babes'** on Harvard campus - opposite of the energy you're bringing."

**Gil's questions**:
- **Is enshittification tightly correlated with monetization?**
- How do you build something with appropriate reach that can be sustained economically **without falling into enshittification machine?**
- Does avoiding enshittification depend on **volunteer labor?**
- Volunteers have sources of income elsewhere - tied into enshittification for most of their lives
- **Open source brilliance** of last 50 years came from this, but **it's not a sustainable strategy**

**Jerry's big question**: "Is it possible to have viable, sustainable, ongoing concern software that **doesn't need to go down the enshittification rat hole?**"

**Significance**: Fundamental tension in community platforms - how to sustain without corrupting. Connects to Call 09 platform problems.

### Shawn Murphy's Thinkertoys

**Building the tool OGM is talking about**

**Status**: Deploying latest version, configuration issues during call

**What it does**:
- Real-time collaborative knowledge tool
- Group edits LLM prompt together
- Run prompt through LLM
- Outputs in **Turtle** (graph knowledge representation format)
- Pump into Thinkertoys, immediately graph it
- **Multiple visualizations**: Tabular, graphical, wiggly graph things
- **Near real-time collaboration with AI**
- AI populates shared knowledge collaboration workspace
- Group springboards off AI output, continues working together

**Last weekend test**: Worked with different crew Saturday, exploring topic in near real-time

**Jerry's invite**: "Send invite to OGM list for pop-up call to try the tool"

**Significance**: Shawn building exactly what group discussing - collaborative AI tools. Will this help OGM move from salon to bodies of work?

---

### AI Tools Already Working

**Practical examples**

**Stacey's podcast solution**:
- Someone shared long AI chat about shutdown
- Stacey ran it through LLM to create **short podcast**
- "Great beginning point for a conversation"
- **Loved that it asked good questions**

**Jerry's anonymized focus group**:
- 60-70 people, anonymized (**Orange Panda**, color + animal)
- Topic, questions ahead of time
- Broken into breakouts to discuss questions briefly
- Typing thoughts and answers
- **AI summarizing each group, cross-fertilizing insights**
- AI: "I think this is what you said" or "I think this is what you've agreed on"
- Quite good at summarization
- "AI was being really, really helpful in ways I hadn't experienced before in that kind of setting"
- **"I look forward to having AIs participating as excellent listeners and summarizers"**

**Gil's Fathom**: Note-taker AI (Jerry resents: "when Gil shows up, he shows up with like **3 different note-takers**")

**Significance**: AI already useful for TLDR, summarization, question-asking. John's vision of AI as participant closer than he thought.

---

### Post Outside In

**Jerry's old policy proposal**

**Problem**: People post brilliant things in private forums - can't retweet, repost, point to them. **Stuff trapped in "bit bucket".**

**Solution**: **Post outside in** - write interesting idea as public post (blog), then share link in private community

**Benefit**:
- Conversation can happen in more public view
- Good stuff not trapped
- Communities move but work remains accessible

**Significance**: Ongoing tension between privacy and discoverability. Connects to Pete's Plex matchmaking paradox (Call 09).

---

### Kevin Jones Returns

**Minimal participation after 3-call absence**

**Last seen**: Call 06 (Sept 4) - finding role helping Swannanoa without being in sadness

**Absence**: Calls 07, 08, 09 (entire Batch 3)

**Return**: Call 10 (Oct 9) - **minimal participation**, suggested John's questions were good

**Status**: Back but quiet - processing? Building?

**Critical**: Was this one-time return or resuming participation? (Spoiler: Call 11 brings MIRACLE)

## Stories Shared

### Jerry: Pi.ai Best Interview Experience

**Summary**: Couple years ago, pi.ai said "what's on your mind?" 90 minutes later, best interview ever. Kept saying "it sounds like you said this, do you mean this?" Raised the conversation. Not Eliza, not stochastic parrot - deeply understanding. "Oh my god, oh my god!" Shook him. Hasn't gone back to that thread.

**Impact**: Example of transformative AI conversation experience.

### Jerry: The Well - First Online Experience

**Summary**: Bulletin board system PicoSpan, Sausalito. Good stuff floating by but couldn't keep up-to-date. Can't remember where good posts were in long threads.

**Impact**: Longstanding problem of knowledge discovery in forums.

### Stacey: Shutdown AI Chat to Podcast

**Summary**: Someone shared long AI chat about shutdown. Stacey ran it through LLM to create short podcast. "Great beginning point for a conversation." Loved that it asked good questions.

**Impact**: Practical TLDR solution in action.

## Frameworks and Concepts

### The Mapping, Not the Map

**Source**: Gene Bellinger to John Warinner
**Description**: Value is in the gerund - the mapping process, not the static map artifact
**Application**: Same with AI conversations - value in conversation, not product

### Post Outside In

**Source**: Jerry Michalski (years ago)
**Description**: Write interesting ideas as public posts first, then share link in private community
**Benefit**: Keeps good stuff accessible, not trapped in bit bucket

### Enshittification

**Source**: Cory Doctorow (implied)
**Gil's question**: Is it tightly correlated with monetization?
**Challenge**: Can platforms sustain economically without falling into it?

### TLDR Agent

**Source**: Jerry Michalski concept
**Description**: LLMs as excellent summarizers/highlighters for long threaded discussions

### Complex Systems Leverage Points

**Source**: Gene Bellinger / Doug Breitbart
**Description**: Maps reveal complex systems, identify where to intervene or contribute
**Purpose**: Better decision-making in nonlinear systems
