# Call 14: OGM Check-in - Consciousness, Bubbles, and Cross-Connections

**Date**: November 6, 2025
**Type**: Check-in (first Thursday of month)
**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

---

## Quick Summary

**Jerry's first psilocybin journey ever** (day before call!) anchored this check-in with profound personal transformation - felt connected to mycelial networks, explored non-local consciousness theory, and discovered GABA's role in filtering reality. The call balanced personal revelation with systemic analysis: **Doug's "OGM as energetic center of gravity"** insight (12 projects, 60% connected through OGM), **Mike's AI bubble drumbeat** (Wall Street Journal daily articles), and Klaus's environmental benefits as "second crop" for farmers. **Doug's verdict on data centers**: "That's the end. Not the beginning of the end. Not a bubble. That's the end of whatever this has been."

## Key Themes

### Jerry's Psilocybin Journey - Non-Local Consciousness

**JERRY'S MOST PROFOUND PERSONAL SHARING**

**Context**:
- **First trip ever** - never done drugs before
- **Day before the check-in call** (Wednesday afternoon)
- Friend in neighborhood, completely trustworthy, safe and lovely
- Friend grew shrooms himself, tested on himself

**The experience**:
- **Felt connected to mycelial networks of the world**
- Felt like **"I was everything all at once-ish"**
- Now understands special effects in movies - **copying what happens when you see everything**
- Tried to leave "little dorms or candles or gateways" to step back into experience without doing whole thing again
- **"Transformative... don't know how, but it was thrilling"**

**Non-local consciousness convergence**:

**Dan Brown's book** ("The Secret of Secrets"):
- Plot point is **non-local consciousness**
- GABA and hallucinogens
- Marginalization of divine feminine

**Sunil Malhotra** (1.5 years ago):
- **"What if consciousness isn't materialized from neurons, but is background radiation of universe?**
- We occupy it, **tune into it like radio station**
- When we die we **meld back into it**"

**Jerry's realization**: Already had non-local consciousness in brain from different research - **same general idea**

**Noetic science**: Getting into "woo-woo noetic science territory" - **beginning to respect a lot more**

**GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid)**:
- **Primary inhibitor in neural system**
- High levels keep us from being overwhelmed
- **Epilepsy**: Precipitous drop causes brain overwhelm and seizure
- Coming out of seizure: **Moments of bliss, connection with infinite**
- **Hallucinogens seem to reduce GABA** so you can perceive what's always happening around you
- **Not generating hallucination, lowering filters**

**Timing convergence**:
- Read about GABA **Tuesday night**
- Had psilocybin journey **Wednesday afternoon**
- Check-in call **Thursday**

**Mr. Rogers story** (April's visit to Pittsburgh museum):
- Mr. Rogers told her **"you're okay just the way you are"** during difficult childhood with mom
- "Kindness Zone" sign for the wall

**Significance**: Jerry's most vulnerable personal sharing. Connects consciousness expansion to information filtering (GABA as filter, hallucinogens lower filter). Echoes Call 04 reality melting - what if reality filters are lowered?

### Doug: OGM as Energetic Center of Gravity

**THE revelation about OGM's impact**

**Doug's tab groups transformation**:
- 250 tabs open across multiple browser windows
- Laptop overwhelmed, **"what do I do now" feeling**
- Discovered **browser tab groups feature** - never knew what it was called
- Able to sort and bucket tabs into groups, close groups, freed up machine resources
- **"This is life-changing for someone like me"**

**Core beliefs**:
- **Every human being has value to add and contribute**
- What do each one of those individuals need in order to be enabled to contribute?
- How do we meet everyone's needs?
- Everything else substantially irrelevant if not germane to those inquiries

**OGM nexus**:
- Touching bunch of projects - **OGM people or people that have dipped in and out**
- Starting to coalesce - **two completely independent projects connect**, Doug aware of both
- Aware of how they complement and fit larger context
- List of about **12 projects, 60% have OGM in common**
- **Hat tip Jerry**: "Being the **energetic center of gravity** out of which a lot of these things connected with, met, and now coalesceable"

**Significance**: OGM's value not in artifacts but in **connective tissue between projects**. Jerry as gravitational center creating cross-connections. Echoes Call 09 salon vs bodies of work - OGM IS creating something, just not visible artifacts.

### Mike: AI Bubble Drumbeat

**Wall Street Journal daily articles**

**Mike's observation**:
- **At least one article daily for last 3 weeks**: "Oh my god, it's an AI bubble!"
- **AOL parallel**: OpenAI is the AOL of our day, **completely overinflated stock price**
- Altman doing exactly the right thing - **using it to buy, do all sorts of deals** that won't look good in 1-2 years
- **Wall Street Journal**: "The U.S. economy is now AI" - **all growth for 12+ months because of data center investment**
- Take that out and **economy's been flat**

**Three bubbles**: Cloud computing, AI chips, cryptocurrency

**Questions**:
- Will it drag down just AI-related companies?
- Will it drag down entire tech sector?
- Will it drag down entire market?
- **Where do you put the money?** (Gold up by factor of 3 because people confused)
- How many thinking of pulling profits from tech investments?

**Mike's position**: Cloudflare stock (employee 130 before IPO), IBM stock, tend to invest in what I know

**Hands poll**: **Most raised hands: There's a bubble.** 3.5 hands: Changing investment strategy

**Significance**: Consensus on AI bubble but divergent views on what it means. Connects to Call 12 progress questions.

### Pete: Weird Territory Past Bubbles

**We're beyond where we've thought about bubbles**

**Big picture**:
- Been in a bubble **since about PC era**
- **One big tech bubble inflation thing** going up and down, changing world and us
- **AI as endgame**: Feels like some kind of endgame
- Either **amazing productivity and social justice**, or **crash hard because we've turned all matter into GPUs**
- Likely outcome: **Some weird thing in the middle**

**Past bubbles**: "It's hard to say this out loud to professional people who care, but **it feels like we're kind of post cash/gold/Bitcoin questions**"

**Weird territory**: "All of that seems like the **wrong questions** at this point. **We're passed where we've even thought about bubbles.** We're in weird territory."

**AI backstop question**: Will AI backstop you? Won't it? Maybe great, but won't be able to eat - **need to apply AI to growing things, delivering food, regenerative soil**

**Significance**: Pete's most philosophical contribution - suggests we're in unprecedented territory where old frameworks don't apply. Echoes Call 04 reality melting.

### Doug: Data Centers - "That's the End"

**Apocalyptic but relieved verdict**

**Observation**: Rate at which **energy technology, battery technology, quantum computing progressing**

**Obsolescence**: **Massive billion-dollar data center investments obsolete in 18 months**

**Doug's assessment**: "On intuitive logical level, **it doesn't make sense. It's gotta blow up.** When it's too good to be true, it defies reality."

**Layoffs**: Biggest players canning **30, 40, 50K people** to divert resource to constructing data centers

**Verdict**: **"That's the end. Not the beginning of the end. Not a bubble. That's the end of whatever this has been."**

**Insane logical conclusion**: "Reached its **insane logical conclusion as a capitalist train run amok**"

**Aftermath**: "Don't know what's after that, but I do know what's ending. **Thank God.** It needed to go away. **We need to do us differently and better if we're not gonna go extinct.**"

**Alex's blockchain parallel**: Graphics cards became obsolete within 18 months during Bitcoin mining (2015) - created backwash second-hand market for games. **All these data centers becoming obsolete maybe produce cheap alternative computing power for something.**

**Significance**: Doug's most apocalyptic statement - not bubble, **the end**. Relief that unsustainable system ending. Hope that obsolete infrastructure gets repurposed.

### Klaus: Food with Thought - Environmental Benefits as Second Crop

**Klaus's regenerative food systems progress**

**Trigger**: Union of Concerned Scientists **"yet another last urgent warning"** - passing tipping points, will be ignored

**Missing piece**: Transition to **"what can you actually do about this?"**

**The problem**:
- **Agriculture of the Middle**: Small to medium-sized farmers can't get into market
- **Food most damaging** part of our interaction with natural world - destroying watersheds, soils, biodiversity
- Has the **capacity to recover, heal, regenerate**
- Large companies (Monsanto, Nestle) automating, "climate smart technology," hugely capital intensive, **will exclude more farmers**

**Klaus's solution - Secondary crop**:
- **Environmental benefits as second revenue stream**
- Farmer has **food crop + environmental benefit crop** linked together
- **Examples**: Mississippi Delta - reduce nitrogen runoff (easy to measure), incentives sufficient for conservative farmers
- **Leverage**: By building secondary revenue stream, **all other things fall into place** - soil health, cover crops, no-till, rotation
- **Market resistance**: "How easy it would be to make an impact, and how **stubbornly resistant the market is** to engage in change"

**Target market**: CSAs + farmers markets = only **3% of total sales**. Get these farmers into **wholesale market** - bundling and aggregating.

**Significance**: Klaus's regenerative food systems work (from Call 06 pivot) showing progress. Environmental benefits as economic incentive = leverage point.

### Scott: Remixability - Ingredients Not Meals

**Create work that gives it a life of its own**

**Kevin McLeod**: Most prolific composer you've never heard of
- **2,000 pieces of royalty-free music** under Creative Commons
- One song played **31.6 billion times** (TikTok, Facebook Reels)

**Concept shift**: "Instead of making meals, **make ingredients or recipes** - things other people can and want to use to create things that are theirs"

**vs**: "Spending time creating something perfect and self-contained, **never to be taken apart**"

**Implication**: **Create work that gives it a life of its own through remixing**

**Significance**: Echoes Call 09 salon vs bodies of work. Maybe OGM creates ingredients (ideas, connections) not meals (finished artifacts).

### David: Growth Metaphors - Sourdough Starter

**Living systems economics needs different growth framework**

**Problem**: Traditional economics relies on growth, but **living systems economics needs different growth framework**

**Zero sum vs abundance**: Tend to get trapped making things a little bit better, **rarely positive sum abundance outcomes**

**Economics as indigenous knowledge**: Don't throw away traditional economics, think of it as **indigenous knowledge - what can we learn from it?**

**Sourdough story**: Woman pioneers **kept sourdough starter alive next to their breasts** crossing mountains - **sourdough growth as metaphor for living growth**

**Question**: **"What metaphors from biological systems around growth inform traditional economics in new ways?"**

**Significance**: Reframing growth - not expansion but cultivation, nurturing, symbiosis.

---

### Gil: Financial Strategy - Asset Allocation

**Practical investment advice**

**Not one bubble**: "Not one big bubble, it's a **series of bubbles** - some stabilized, some not"

**2008 parallel**: Government bailed out some banks and not others - **whole too-big-to-fail game**, in another one now

**Ben Hunt numbers**: Tech sector **~5% of GDP** now pouring more money into economy than consumer sector **~30% of GDP** - **only thing keeping economy afloat**

**Masking tariffs**: Totally swamping effects of tariffs, whatever else might be happening

**Microsoft data centers**: "Innovation at Microsoft" by Joanne Garvin - Data Center of the Future project, designed **net-zero energy and net-zero water** data centers. Doesn't seem to be building them - theoretical possibility.

**Financial advice**: **Find your asset allocation strategy and stay there** - rebalance periodically, that's how you move tech profits into other sectors

**Gil's difference**: Should be **much more offshore than we are now** - diversify out of US into international because of **instability here**

**Significance**: Practical, grounded advice amid apocalyptic speculation.
