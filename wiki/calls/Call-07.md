# Call 07: On Collaboration (9/11 Anniversary)

**Date**: September 11, 2025
**Type**: Topical discussion
**Duration**: ~97 minutes
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski
**Provocateur**: Scott Moehring

---

## Quick Summary

On the 9/11 anniversary, Scott Moehring arrived late and proposed a provocative distinction: **collaboration vs teamwork**. His thesis: True collaboration requires unique individuals creating something none could create alone - swap one person and the result fundamentally changes. Teamwork is plug-and-play roles. The group wrestled with this, revealing deep skepticism from those who've tried cross-organizational work (Kevin: "ships passing, lowering drawbridge briefly"), while Gil saw collaboration as far more common. The call illustrated its own challenge - defining collaboration proved as difficult as doing it.

## Key Themes

### Scott's Collaboration vs Teamwork Distinction

**Core framework**

**Collaboration** (Scott's definition):
- Unique individuals pairing/grouping up
- Creating something they **couldn't create separately**
- Not because of manpower but because of **unique interaction**
- **Change one person = fundamentally different result**
- Shared vision both can articulate the same way
- Result named after the individuals/organizations involved

**Teamwork** (Scott's definition):
- Plug-and-play roles, bucket brigade
- Someone in charge, someone sets vision
- Everyone fulfills their role
- **Can swap people in same role without fundamental change**
- Executing recipes already created

**Scott's test**: "If collaborators can't say what they're doing in the same way, maybe they're not actually collaborating."

**Scott's skepticism**: Rarely sees true collaboration - mostly teamwork or one person's vision with others getting on board.

**Significance**: Clearest definition debate in OGM series so far - specific, testable distinction.

---

### Restaurant Kitchen Example

**Scott's illustration**

**Collaboration phase**: Head chef + restaurateur developing restaurant, menu, experience together

**Teamwork phase**: Kitchen executing recipes day-to-day

**The shift**: Same people, but move from unique collaborative creation to standardized teamwork execution.

**Implication**: Most "collaboration" is actually teamwork. True collaboration is creation phase, rare and difficult.

---

### Filmmaking: Collaboration vs Teamwork

**Group examples**

**Teamwork** (Jerry & Gil):
- Hollywood roles - gaffer, best boy, grip
- Assigned roles, plug-and-play
- Can replace people in same role

**Collaboration** (Jerry):
- Mike Leigh director inventing script with actors together
- Can't swap actors - entire work would be different

**Also collaboration** (Gil):
- Robert Icky & Andrew Scott choosing Hamlet then inventing the play together
- Unique partnership creating unique interpretation

**Pattern**: Creation (collaboration) vs execution (teamwork).

---

### Practical Skepticism from Cross-Organizational Work

**Kevin and Mike's hard-won wisdom**

**Kevin Jones**:
- Scott's definition: Groups with own goals finding bridge between them
- Kevin: "I've never... I've done that a lot, and you get... you know, Barney, I like you, you like me, but **nobody changes from their own goals**"
- **"Like ships passing, lower drawbridge briefly, but nobody diverts from their goal"**
- "Doesn't happen the way Scott's talking about it"

**Mike Nelson**:
- Often **1 person does 80% of work, 4 people take all credit**
- Some of those 4 actually getting in the way, making silly suggestions, delaying
- Skeptical of "melding of minds" creating new organism
- **Need champion with deadline and motivation**
- Collaborations can wander and wander without deadline
- "Collaboration for collaboration's sake is problematic"

**Pattern**: People who've tried cross-organizational collaboration see limited success. Organizational gravity keeps everyone in their own orbits.

---

### Gil's Word Debate Frustration

**Echoes Call 05 sense-making**

**Gil's concern**: "Very problematic conversation - debating words we're using in different ways about meanings we aren't clear about."

**Overlapping things**:
- Nature of human interaction for common purpose
- Word labels we give to different types of interaction

**Terms in play**: Collaboration, cooperation, coordination, compromise

**Gil's experience**: Seems very different than Scott's - sees collaboration as far more common.

**Callback**: Echoes Call 05 sense-making definition debate - "What do we mean by sense?"

**Significance**: Group struggles to have productive conversations when using words differently. Meta-problem across multiple calls.

### Ugly Oranges Negotiation Case

**Jerry's Management 101 story**

**Setup**:
- Two teams need to buy last shipment of ugly oranges
- Each has $1M budget
- Apparently competitive situation

**Twist**:
- One team needs **pith of peel** (cancer serum)
- Other team needs **juice**
- Complementary, not competitive!

**Solution**:
- Pay $1 for shipment
- Split oranges appropriately
- Spend rest of budget on research

**Lesson**: **Investigate what each party actually needs** - apparent competition may be complementary goals.

**Significance**: Most "collaboration failures" might be failure to discover complementary needs.

---

## Frameworks Introduced

### Collaboration vs Teamwork Distinction

**Proposed by**: Scott Moehring

**Collaboration**: Unique interaction of specific individuals creating novel result

**Teamwork**: Defined roles executing pre-existing plan

**Test**: Can you swap one person without fundamentally changing the result?

### Ugly Oranges Negotiation Case

**Source**: Management 101
**Shared by**: Jerry Michalski

**Setup**: $1M budget, must buy last shipment, competing team

**Solution**: Discover complementary needs (pith vs juice), split oranges for $1, spend rest on research

**Lesson**: Investigate actual needs - apparent competition may be complementary

### Princess Bride Reference

**Quote**: "You keep using that word. I don't think that means what you think that means" (Inigo Montoya)

**Usage**: Scott's meme for organization culture buzzwords

**Application**: "Collaboration" used synonymously with "let's get together and work"

### Etymology

**Word**: Collaboration
**Origin**: Latin - two words meaning "work together"

**Scott's critique**: Ostensibly means anytime 2+ people doing something, but we're using it more narrowly.

---

## Questions Raised

- What is collaboration really?
- How is collaboration different from teamwork?
- How common is true collaboration (Scott's definition)?
- When people ask for collaboration, do they really want it or just teamwork?
- If collaborators can't articulate the same vision, are they collaborating?
- Why do we use "collaboration" for what's really teamwork?
- Can cross-organizational groups with different goals truly collaborate?
- How do we have productive conversations when we're using words differently?

## Participation Notes

**Scott Moehring**: Provocateur, arrived late, presented collaboration vs teamwork distinction, restaurant kitchen example, skeptical of collaboration claims, working during call (common pattern)

**Jerry Michalski**: Facilitator, Ugly Oranges case, Mike Leigh film example, exploring Scott's distinction

**Gil Friend**: Challenged word debate (echoing Call 05), experience differs from Scott's, theater collaboration examples (Robert Icky/Andrew Scott Hamlet)

**Kevin Jones**: Explained Scott's definition re: cross-organizational goals, **skeptical it works ("ships passing, lowering drawbridge")** - **LAST APPEARANCE BEFORE 3-CALL ABSENCE**

**Mike Nelson**: Skeptical - 1 person does 80%, 4 take credit; need champion and deadline

**Alex Kladitis**: Present, noted others covered his points

**Others**: Present but not prominent in opening discussion

---

## Emotional Tone

Intellectual, definitional, some frustration with word debates (Gil), practical skepticism (Mike, Kevin), exploratory. Less heavy than previous calls, more cerebral.

---

## Special Notes

- **Call on 9/11 anniversary** - noted by Jerry
- Jerry forgot to turn on recorder initially
- Scott working during call (common pattern for him)
- **Princess Bride meme** used to frame discussion
- **Gil's frustration with word debates echoes Call 05** sense-making discussion
- Scott's distinction **clear and specific** - collaboration requires unique individuals, teamwork doesn't
- Practical skepticism from people who've tried cross-organizational work (Kevin, Mike)
- Gil sees collaboration as much more common than Scott does - different life experiences
- **KEVIN'S LAST CALL BEFORE 3-CALL ABSENCE** (Calls 07-09 = Batch 3, Kevin absent entire batch)

---

## Cross-Call Connections

### Backward Connections

- **Call 05** - Gil's "what do we mean by sense?" → Gil's "debating words used differently"
- **Call 06** - Kevin working on Swannanoa coordination → practical experience informs his skepticism about cross-organizational collaboration

### Forward Connections

- **Calls 08-09** - Kevin **ABSENT** (continues through Call 09, returns minimally Call 10)
- **Call 11** - Kevin returns with Mennonite miracle - is that collaboration or teamwork per Scott's distinction?
- **Call 08** - Abundance definitions - Stacey's speed round format prevents extended debate (learning from Calls 05 and 07)

### Thematic Connections

**Part of Batch 3: Foundations** (Calls 07-09)

Call 07 continues definition obsession pattern (Calls 05, 07, 08, 09, 12 all wrestle with definitions). Scott provides clearest framework yet, but group still can't agree.

---

## Batch Context

**Batch 3 (Calls 07-09): Foundations**

Definitional foundations explored: collaboration (Call 07), abundance (Call 08), OGM itself (Call 09). Pattern: Need clear definitions before building, but achieving definitional clarity proves nearly impossible.

**Note**: Kevin Jones **ABSENT ENTIRE BATCH** after Call 07 skepticism about collaboration. Returns minimally Call 10, triumphantly Call 11.
