# Call 13: How to Render Crony Capitalism Obsolete

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Type**: Topical discussion
**Duration**: ~90 minutes (estimate)
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

---

## Quick Summary

Mike Nelson framed crony capitalism and disinformation as "two drivers of all bad things in the world," sparking a wide-ranging exploration of systemic corruption and potential solutions. **Alex delivered shocking Russia mob rule story** (hundreds of thousands to millions killed during privatization), while **John Kelly proposed "bounded influence" reputational economies**. **Stacey's condo story** showed community belonging as anti-corruption ("when you feel something belongs to you, you usually steal from outside"), and **Alex championed radical transparency** (every government conversation documented within hours). But **Stacey's critical observation**: "Secrets don't matter. There is no shame. Nobody believes anything" - transparency harder when shame mechanism broken.

## Key Themes

### Defining Crony Capitalism vs Cronyism

**Conceptual clarity**

**Mike's framing**: "Crony capitalism and disinformation are two drivers of all bad things in the world: wars, Trump, repression of human rights country after country"

**Jerry's challenge**: "Was there no crony capitalism under progressives? MAGA critique of left IS that it was crony capitalism"

**Gil's distinction**: "Two different themes: capitalism and cronyism. Maybe add socialism to the mix."

**Mike's response**: "Crony socialism is a form of crony capitalism - **follow the money**. Socialism in air quotes. Marxism never got a chance."

**Alex's insight**: **"Cronyism is independent of any political system. One's a political system (capitalism/socialism), one's a system of self-interest (cronyism)."**

**Significance**: Cronyism transcends political systems - it's about power networks, not ideology.

### Alex: Russia Mob Rule Horror Story

**Extreme version of crony capitalism**

**Context**: Russia privatization after Soviet collapse

**What happened** (Alex):
- When privatization happened, **people didn't know what they were given**
- **Mob rule**: Went to old people, said **"sign over or die"**
- **Generally killed them anyway**
- **Hundreds of thousands to millions extorted and killed**
- Lots of work being done on this now

**Current system**:
- **Siloviki**: Putin's former FSB/KGB buddies who own privatized enterprises
- Scratch each other's backs
- **1.25M+ Russians dead in Ukraine** (Jerry's number; Mike corrected: 250K dead, 1.2M casualties total)
- Astonishing Putin maintains power

**What to call it**: Not communist anymore, not really capitalist, not democratic - **kleptocracy**? "Weird mutt mix of stuff"

**Significance**: Extreme example of what happens when cronyism becomes total. Historical trauma still playing out.

---

### Mike: Copyright Industry Corruption

**Blatant crony capitalism example**

**Lawrence Lessig**: Fighting noble fight for years, lost **Eldred vs Reno** copyright case at Supreme Court - "world would have been different"

**Mike's insight**: "Corruption caused by copyright industry drives the politics and policy"

**How it works**:
- Senators/congressmen **promised million-dollar-a-year jobs** running RIAA, Motion Picture Association
- Invite almost every White House staffer to **exclusive preview theater 5 blocks from White House**
- **Blanket everyone** so everybody thinks movie industry is most important industry in America
- Not just focusing on policymakers - **blanketing entire ecosystem**

**Significance**: Corruption isn't just money - it's **access, conversations, ecosystem capture**.

---

### John Kelly: Reputational Economy with Bounded Influence

**Proposed middle territory between economic and democratic systems**

**Current problems**:

**Economics world**: Transactions, measurement, **gross ignoring of non-monetary values**

**Democracy world**: People express intentions, should have consequences, **very fragile**

**Reputational economies exist but problematic**: Social media followers, influencers

**John's proposal**:
- Everyone has **influence (not just votes)**, some have more than others but **BOUNDED**
- **Cannot be taken down to zero influence**
- **Cannot have more than some maximum amount**
- Earn social capital by **contributing to community** (not Chinese social credit way - no jaywalking penalties)
- **NOT in hands of government or corporation** - quasi-public entity
- Periodically fired at social problems (like civic assemblies)
- **Isolate issue, select people based on their earned influence**

**Significance**: Attempts to solve "money = speech" problem while avoiding authoritarian social credit. But who runs the system?

---

### Alex: Radical Transparency

**Forcing secrets into daylight**

**Alex's solution**:
- **Power of cronyism is secrecy or delayed revelation**
- Force government and everyone: **If you chat with government minister, produce document within HOURS**
- Recording, notes of what was spoken about - **out in open within seconds**
- **All money on blockchain** - every penny traceable, anyone can question
- Commercial confidentiality objection: **"Crony capitalism has become such a problem that's irrelevant now"**
- Secret Service stuff objection: **Still need transparency**
- **Impractical? Maybe.** But these guys good at covering tracks under name of secrecy

**Estonia example**: When got country back, went all electronic. **X-Road platform** selling to other countries. **Elected officials had to post calendars online.**

**Manhattan failure**: Andrew Roche and Mikha Sifry tried to run on **open calendaring for elected officials** in Manhattan - **could not get it through**

**Jerry's Clarence Thomas insight**: **"It's not the money that matters in the fancy jet, it's the conversations at those retreats. The conversations that matter, not the goodies."**

**Significance**: Transparency targets conversations, not just money. Estonia shows it's possible; Manhattan shows how hard.

### Stacey: Community Belonging as Anti-Corruption

**The human part - small and local approach**

**Condo story**:
- Became condo association president
- Changed rule: **Contractor living in building became VP, allowed to do work**
- Got **family discount + showed contractor's discount** on materials
- Built trust, **saved money**, contractor got work in his own home
- **"Mental thing where we all belonged to the community"**

**Mondamí example**: **90,000 community members** working together. People say "theft!" Stacey: **"When you feel something belongs to you and your community, even if you steal, you usually steal from outside your community."**

**Human nature**: Needs to be considered in system design

**Significance**: Belonging creates internal norm enforcement. Can't scale to national level easily, but powerful locally. Connects to Call 06 Kevin's "third places" insight.

---

### Stacey: Shamelessness and Fake News

**Deteriorating norms**

**Two sectors**: "Only **entertainment and finance** repeatedly hear good people say: **'You gotta work with bad people if you're gonna make it in this business.'** Always wants to throw up."

**Government change**:
- Used to be you didn't hear that in government
- People afraid they'd be **outed, held secrets over you**
- **NOW: Secrets don't matter. There is no shame.**
- Don't have to worry being outed because it's **"fake news"**
- **Nobody believes anything**

**Implication**: **Transparency still necessary but harder to leverage when shame mechanism broken**

**Significance**: Profoundly important observation - transparency assumes shame matters. If nothing is shameful, transparency loses power.

## Frameworks and Concepts

### Crony Capitalism vs Cronyism

**Source**: Alex Kladitis
**Description**: Cronyism is independent of political system - it's self-interest system, not political system

### Follow the Money

**Source**: Mike Nelson
**Description**: Crony socialism is crony capitalism - it's all about the capital

### Bounded Influence

**Source**: John Kelly
**Description**: Reputational economy where influence is earned but bounded - floor and ceiling

### Radical Transparency

**Source**: Alex Kladitis
**Description**: Every government conversation documented within hours/seconds, all money on blockchain

### Community Belonging as Anti-Corruption

**Source**: Stacey Druss
**Description**: When people feel they belong, they're less likely to exploit - steal from outside, not inside

### Conversations Matter More Than Gifts

**Source**: Jerry Michalski (Clarence Thomas example)
**Description**: Corruption is access and influence through conversations, not just money/goodies

---

## Examples

**Extreme crony capitalism**: Russia (Siloviki), North Korea, Assad's Syria, Maduro's Venezuela

**Sectoral cronyism**: Copyright industry (RIAA, MPAA), Entertainment industry, Finance industry

**Transparency attempts**: Estonia X-Road, Andrew Roche Manhattan calendaring (failed), Lawrence Lessig Root Strikers

**Community models**: Stacey's condo association, Mondamí 90K members

---

## Questions Raised

- How to render crony capitalism obsolete?
- Is cronyism independent of political systems?
- How do we protect distributed ownership from being expropriated?
- Can reputational economies work without becoming like Chinese social credit?
- Is radical transparency practical or will secrecy always win?
- How do we leverage transparency when shame is broken (fake news era)?
- Who should run reputational economy system - not government, not corporation, but what?
- Can community belonging scale beyond local?
- What replaces accountability when "nobody believes anything"?
