# Call 02: Check-in Call (Kevin's Throat Level Sadness)

**Date**: August 7, 2025
**Type**: Check-in (Jerry away, Klaus hosting)
**Duration**: ~105 minutes
**Facilitator**: Klaus Mager (filling in for Jerry who is in Italy)

---

## Quick Summary

With Jerry on vacation in Italy, Klaus hosted OGM's second call as an open check-in format. The call is most memorable for **Kevin Jones's darkening trauma** - his situation has deteriorated significantly since Call 01, with FEMA failing, mutual aid collapsing, and community leaders walking away from Swannanoa. Kevin asked not to be asked about it again. The call also featured hopeful moments: Ken Homer's Spain move plans, Jessie Upp's DayBalancer project, and Mike Nelson's digital leadership reflections.

## Key Themes

### Kevin's Deepening Crisis

**CRITICAL MOMENT IN KEVIN'S STORY ARC**

**Kevin Jones's update** (darker than Call 01):

- Still no permanent housing, moving to apartment in Asheville end of month
- **Discovered he wants walkable urban life, not farm** - 15 years loving farm, but disaster changed everything
- FEMA promises unfulfilled - federal money not coming
- Mutual aid groups **collapsed** - paid workers giving up
- Community gathering places **gone** - no grocery, post office, restaurants
- Social fabric shredding - deeply involved people walking away
- **Deb Trigg** (community leader) recuperating in France
- Kevin **giving up on Swannanoa entirely**, can't bear it anymore
- "Trauma in the land" visible and overwhelming

**Kevin's explicit request**: Asked not to be questioned about Swannanoa again - **"throat level sadness"**

**Trajectory from Call 01 to Call 02**:
- Call 01: Fled to Europe, community leadership exhaustion, planning to move
- Call 02: Now actually moving, mutual aid collapsed, explicitly giving up

This is the **nadir** of Kevin's story arc before his 3-call absence (Calls 07-09) and eventual miracle in Call 11.

---

### Urban vs Rural Life Preference

**Converging pattern: Kevin + Ken both choosing walkable cities**

**Kevin Jones**:
- Loved farm for 15 years
- Disaster changed preference fundamentally
- Moving to Asheville apartment - wants walkable to cafes, groceries, restaurants
- Can't bear Swannanoa trauma anymore

**Ken Homer**:
- Got Spanish visa appointment after 3 months trying
- Planning December/January move to Valencia
- Excited about walkable, clean city with great public transit
- Bike infrastructure, civilized urban life

**Pattern**: After experiencing or witnessing disaster/dysfunction, preference shifts toward walkable urban resilience.

---

### DayBalancer Community Matching

**Jessie Upp's passion project update**

**Platform**: Talent/community matching using **ikigai framework**
- What you love
- What you're good at
- What the world needs
- What you can be paid for

**Current status**:
- 400 users
- Built without monetization plan (community first)
- Now pivoting to event industry for sustainability
- Conversation with Dave at Campfire about giving gifts to community

**Challenge**: How to maintain momentum between annual events?

**Philosophy**:
- People living in **scarcity mode** vs abundance mindset
- Everyone always has something to give
- Focus on gifts, not just needs

**Significance**: Ikigai framework introduced here will return in Call 08 (Abundance) as Jessie's definition of abundance.

---

### Digital Leadership Vision

**Mike Nelson preparing keynote for Taiwan**

**Audience**: World Innovation Technology and Services Alliance - 50 national IT trade associations in Taipei, then Manila

**Central argument**: Need for **political vision in digital era**

**Problem**: Lack of coordinated digital vision causes drift in 7 directions

**Example**: Clinton Administration 1993 - effective digital leadership coordinating policy across:
- Encryption conflicts (police vs privacy/security experts)
- Copyright conflicts in emerging internet era
- Infrastructure coordination
- International standards

**Current challenge**: Taiwan's 5-branch government complexity

**Mike's thesis**: Without political leadership providing vision, digital policy fragments and fails.

---

### Community Coordination Crisis

**Klaus Mager's observation**

Many fragmented initiatives lacking coordination:
- Different communities working on similar problems
- No sustained engagement between events
- Momentum problem - annual gatherings, then nothing
- DayBalancer trying to solve this, but challenge is widespread

**Connection to Swannanoa**: Federal coordination failing, local coordination collapsing, no bridges between efforts.

---

## Stories Shared

### Kevin: Community Collapse Continuation

**Summary**: Situation deteriorated from Call 01. FEMA failing, mutual aid collapsed, community leaders (including Deb Trigg) walking away. Kevin moving to Asheville, giving up on Swannanoa entirely. Throat level sadness.

**Impact**: Darkest point in Kevin's arc. Shows progression from crisis to despair. Asked not to be questioned about it again.

### Ken: Valencia Spain Move

**Impact**: Positive counterpoint to Kevin's trauma. Choosing walkable urban quality of life proactively.

### Jessie: DayBalancer Journey

**Summary**: Built passion project for community first, monetization second. Now 400 users, realized needs to pivot to events industry. Conversation with Dave at Campfire about giving gifts.

**Impact**: Example of building for community, then figuring out sustainability. Scarcity vs abundance mindset.

### Mike: Digital Leadership Keynote

**Summary**: Speaking to 50 national IT trade associations about need for political vision in digital era. Lessons from Clinton Administration 1990s coordination.

**Impact**: Themes of vision, coordination, leadership in complex systems - echoes Kevin's coordination collapse.

## Emotional Tone

**Mixed** - Hope (Ken's Spain plans), deep trauma (Kevin's continued devastation), practical challenges (Jessie's monetization, Mike's travel).

Kevin's "throat level sadness" sets darker tone than Call 01. His explicit request not to be asked again signals withdrawal.

---

## Batch Context

**Batch 1 (Calls 01-03): Grounding**

Call 02 shows **progression** of Kevin's trauma from Call 01. Pattern: Personal collapse (Kevin) → Information collapse (Call 03 trust). Grounding establishes foundational challenges across multiple levels.
