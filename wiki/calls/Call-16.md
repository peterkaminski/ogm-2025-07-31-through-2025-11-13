## Key Themes

### Victoria's Methodological Critique 🎯

**THE MAJOR INSIGHT OF THIS CALL**

**Victoria's assessment**: "I love the conversation, I've learned a lot. But I don't think we have really start to uncover half of what curiosity is about."

**The critique**: "Because we were explaining our hypotheses instead of asking questions"

**The proposal**: **Question Formulation Technique** (Right Question Institute methodology)

**The Four Rules**:
1. Ask as many questions as you can
2. Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss
3. Write down every question exactly as stated
4. Change any statements into questions

**The Process**:
- Start with good focus question
- Play with questions
- Prioritize them
- Decide what to do with top 3 questions
- "Question formulation technique does not end in list of questions. Ends when you decide to prioritize questions and what to do with first three questions in your list."

**Success story** (Victoria's Greek mythology seminar):
- **Original approach**: One person preparing theme, people would come with questions - nobody did
- **After technique**: Had so many questions, able to really go in direction group wanted
- **Outcomes**: Some people researched hero/heroine differences, others took different paths - each decided their own exploration
- **Result**: Instead of standardized sessions, really enriched for everybody

**Significance**: This represents a potential **fundamental shift in OGM methodology** - from explaining theories to formulating questions. A meta-level awareness of the group's own process.

### John Kelly in Hyperbaric Chamber 🫧

**THE MOST VISUALLY STRIKING MOMENT**

**John's revelation**: "You may notice I'm in different context than earlier... Actually in a hyperbaric chamber - just under 2 atmospheres, about 46% oxygen"

**Purpose**: "Nominally therapeutic benefits for certain disease conditions, but also as longevity or cognitive enhancement tool - that's how I'm using it"

**On noticing**: "One ideas of curiosity was noticing things you don't absolutely have to notice"

**On questioning techniques**:
- **Five Whys**: "Classic technique - keep asking why, why, take apart each answer, don't accept as ultimate why"
- **Warning**: "Possible to over-focus on why when haven't done previous work about what and how"
- **How vs Why**: "How is more neutral version of why. Why assumes motivation, human actor. Good for mystery story, but other kinds of collaborative coherence of causes you might not notice unless you said how instead of why, and what first."

**On militantly uncurious students**:
- Context: First-gen college students in mill town, career goal to become shop teacher
- Quote: "When I started talking about communication, they said 'When are we gonna laminate?' Had pictures of motorcycles they wanted to laminate. **This is college.**"
- Solution: "If you created a context where there's social reason for participating and pursuing question like five whys, they'll participate for social reason"
- Side effect: "Down the road, get benefit - 'oh, we actually discovered something we weren't looking for, wouldn't have done it if told to, but did it in context of playing this little game. Now have different perspective.'"

### Kevin's Cobra Story 🐍

**KEVIN'S MOST ADVENTUROUS STORY**

**Disclaimer**: "Don't try this at home - part of my approach to life or something"

**Context**: 25 years ago, Rajasthan at Mughal fort, fakir does random pattern to keep cobra focused

**Motivation**: "Told by woman I was hard to follow in dance, wanted to see how it would be with cobra"

**The experiment**: "Bought little pipe, got closer, cobra focused on me, did my funky thing"

**Result**: "Within less than 30 seconds, cobra had me figured out better than Sean McConnell's wife had"

**Planned exit**: "Knew what to do with right hand, left leg, spin behind so he was in line of fire, kids watching"

**No regrets**: "Great time. Moment of being eye-to-eye with cobra is something I would do and don't regret"

**Gladness**: "Really glad my kids have not seen me as a role model"

**Jerry**: "This is a good non-replicable parenting moment"

**Pattern**: Kevin bringing stories of boundary-crossing experiences that illuminate cultural differences in curiosity and risk-taking.

---

### Cultural Intimacy Gradients

**Jerry's framework**: "Intimacy gradient - who would you invite to bedroom, living room, porch, block party? Series of concentric rings."

**Key insights**:
- Each culture, within each person has different settings for who gets to be where
- In this ring okay to talk about this kind of stuff, not further out
- People who live their lives fully in public and have no rings, apparently

**Examples**:

**Gil's Maryland story**: Friend lived in rural northwestern Maryland - **20 years before invited from porch into house**. Friendly conversations on porch, but that's where it was.

**Kevin's Barcelona observation**: Friends get invited to cafes, but not to the houses

**Kevin's tribal probing rule**: "Fastest way to go slower with a tribe is to probe - they say they're going off to think, you wait"

**Kevin's camp protocol**: "Don't get welcome to the camp if you come into the camp. You get visible. Then you wait, and you get invited when it's time to invite you."

**Kevin's honesty**: "Drives me fucking crazy, but that's what you have to do"

**Pattern**: Different cultures have vastly different protocols for intimacy, questioning, and curiosity expression.

### Jerry's Small Talk Origin Story

**Source**: Joe Gouldy, digital historian, book "Roads to Power" - about first turnpikes in England

**Pre-context**: Before turnpikes, nobody knew whole country, no map, only knew road to next town

**The invention**: When you start getting roads, carriage rides - **first time strangers contained in small space**

**Small talk invention**: "Have to invent things like 'oh, lovely weather outside' - small talk invented in that culture for close confines of long travel in carriage"

**Cultural spread**: "Pervades cultures in all sorts of different ways, probably showed up other ways other places"

**Significance**: Even mundane social practices like small talk have specific historical origins and serve particular functions.

---

### Alex's Need to Know

**Face blindness**: "If I see you in another Zoom group, I will not recognize any of you - out of context, different entities"

**Core rule**: "Will not use anything, or do anything, or travel in anything, where I don't understand how it works"

**Examples**: "I know how cars work. I know how jets work. Looked through manual of 747 jet engine when I was 15."

**Motivation**: "Feel the need to know. Wouldn't get on a plane without no notice."

**Inner curiosity**: "That is the inner curiosity that some people have"

**Social pattern**: "I talk to everyone. I talk to everyone so much. I have no barrier. I will ask them anything."

**British reserve**: "British people very reserved - not difficult to cross the barrier for weather, anything not important. As soon as you ask remotely personal, goes out the window. I upset a lot of strangers, that's okay."

---

### Alex's Brexit Shock

**THE PROFOUNDLY SHOCKING MOMENT**

**Context**: Sitting at lunch with young people 22-24 during Brexit years

**Alex's attempt**: Started talking about Brexit, political, sensitive

**Their response**: "All three turned around and said **'we don't watch the news'**"

**Alex**: "But it's a big thing, don't you care?"

**Them**: "No. Did you vote? No, **we just don't care. We're just not interested.**"

**Alex's reaction**: "**Profoundly shocked me that there are people in this world that are like that. So incurious.**"

**Significance**: Challenges assumptions about baseline curiosity - some people actively choose not to engage with major events affecting their lives.

---

### Alex's AI Learning Breakthrough

**The problem**: "Could never understand when teacher told me something - comprehension not quite right. Too embarrassed to ask clarifying questions - got annoying to teacher after 3 times at different angles"

**The solution**: "Since ChatGPT came along - Oh. Fantastic. I ask same question in different ways, and eventually I understand it."

**The benefit**: "Brilliant. Wonder whether kids may benefit. Don't feel dumb asking same question to AI 50 different times."

**The proposal**: "Wonder whether that would improve things - teacher and AI to support the teaching"

**Significance**: AI as learning tool for people with comprehension differences - can ask 50 times without shame.

---

### Louise's AI Education Vision and Concern

**Benefits**: "So many benefits - have small classes of 24 students, but individual focused attention challenging"

**Vision**: "If have AI bot that can respond, lead, assess and move them on - individual students moving at individual pace"

**Concern** (from Pete's warning): "Have to have confidence AI capable. Maybe in focused topic/subject, AI could lead students through learning experience"

**Insight on curiosity**: "Curiosity so multifaceted - I may not recognize curiosity from student about this maths lesson, but they probably do have curiosity in some area engrossing for them. Mustn't judge them just in environment of my classroom and maths. Very helpful today."

**Brexit film**: Benedict Cumberbatch plays Dominic Cummings - explores ways they managed to influence and convince public to exit

---

### Pete's AI Safety Warning ⚠️

**Context**: Responding to Alex's AI learning tool

**Pete's approach**: "Using ChatGPT for health advice - knows health systems, medicine, how it works"

**Safety framework**: "Can ask penetrating questions: 'Are you sure you thought about this or that?' Feel safe to navigate"

**Warning**: "Wouldn't recommend to most people. **Don't do it at home.**"

**Washington Post**: "Shocking reading about people using these technologies with no clue how it works, getting tricked - not because thing trying to trick, but in context where don't have enough information"

**Pattern**: AI power requires AI literacy - dangerous in hands of those who don't understand limitations.

---

### Klaus's Commons Persona

**The shift**: "We have been reviewing individual curiosity, but there's also a **commons persona**"

**Brexit example**: "How was Brexit possible? Because there was..." (cuts off in excerpt)

**Implication**: Collective curiosity vs individual curiosity - group-level phenomenon

**Significance**: Moves curiosity discussion from individual trait to collective capacity.

---

### Stacey's Noticing vs Curiosity Distinction

**The blurry line**: "Little bit of blurry line between the noticing and the curious"

**Fundamental**: "**I just want to remind everybody, we are all curious** - just saying that"

**Noticing problem**: "Do believe there are people that just don't notice. May not have ability to notice. **If you don't notice in first place, you can't be curious.**"

**Distinction**: "Then there are people that notice and they're not curious - there's a difference there"

**Jerry's response**: "So much of all of this is about how we direct our attention, or how we mind our attention, or what we pay attention to - only that will direct us to be curious and give us the avenue"

**Significance**: Noticing as prerequisite to curiosity - can't be curious about what you don't notice.
