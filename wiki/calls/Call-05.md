# Call 05: Sense-Making - Frustrations and Definitions

**Date**: August 28, 2025
**Type**: Meta-discussion / Salon
**Duration**: ~96 minutes
**Facilitator**: Jerry Michalski

---

## Quick Summary

Jerry asked the group to share frustrations with sense-making, expecting complaints about filter bubbles and disinformation. Instead, **Gil asked the foundational question: "What do we mean by 'sense'?"** - derailing the entire agenda brilliantly. The call became a meta-discussion about definitions, with process-oriented people (Marc-Antoine, Ken) clashing productively with outcome-oriented people (Alex, Mike). Mike championed IETF's "rough consensus and running code," while Ken shared the beautiful Yosemite story about "organ failure" as conflict definition. Jerry confessed: "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done."

## Key Themes

### Gil's Foundational Challenge

**"What do we mean by 'sense'?"**

**Gil's questions** (derailing Jerry's agenda beautifully):
- Does sense mean interpretation of reality satisfying to me?
- Does it mean shared interpretation?
- Does it mean shared commitment to action, consent, decisions, coordination?
- Most conversation seems about goals/decision-making - is that a subset?
- Premature attention to goals implies tacit sense-making already happened

**Marc-Antoine's response**: "We're negotiating shared meaning right now - that's the process."

**Ken Homer's response**: Expansive, exponentially synthetic definitions vs reductive final definitions.

**Significance**: Gil's question became THE topic, illustrating exactly the problem being discussed - can't make sense together if we don't agree what "sense" means.

---

### Frustrations with Sense-Making

**Jerry asked participants to share frustrations before solutions**

**Examples shared**:

- **Eric in chat**: Lack of shared context due to filter bubbles
- **Mike**: Pervasive disinformation - people actively preventing sense-making
- **Mike**: Need for complete consensus allows one person to hold all hostage
- **Doug**: Starting at Chapter 3 or 4, not fundamentals
- **Doug**: "Collective" as problematic aggregation that doesn't exist
- **Jerry**: OGM hasn't done much sense-making, just salon conversations
- **Gil**: Not clear what we mean by "sense"
- **Alex**: No thread or objective, solution-oriented people get lost

**Pattern**: Frustrations reveal fundamental disagreements about what sense-making IS.

### IETF Model: Rough Consensus and Running Code

**Mike Nelson's ideal process**

**Source**: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

**Elements**:
- **Humming instead of voting** - anonymous technical judgment
- Overwhelming loud hum vs minor dissenting hum = rough consensus
- People hum for best technical solution even if it doesn't help their company
- **NOT complete consensus** - avoids single-person veto problem
- **Test: Does it work?** (running code)
- Need goal AND deadline or higher power pushing toward consensus

**Mike's experience**: Negotiated at US Congress and UN (World Summit on Information Society, Internet Governance Forum)

**WSIS failure story**:
- 20+ years ago, Geneva/Tunis
- No common goal: US wanted human rights in cyberspace, China wanted to water down UN Human Rights Declaration, Tehran/Syria guys just wanted expense-paid weeks in Geneva
- Supposed to have 3 meetings, stretched to 5 by constant objections
- Complete consensus requirement allowed 1-2 people to hold all hostage

**Significance**: Without shared goal and deadline, sense-making fails spectacularly.

### Collective Intelligence Cycle

**Marc-Antoine Parent's framework**

**Source**: Simon Buckingham Shum

**Stages**:
1. Collective sensing
2. Collective sense-making
3. Collective ideation
4. Collective decision
5. Collective action
6. Loop back

**Marc-Antoine's insights**:
- World more complex than any one person - **need diversity of perspectives**
- **Divergence before convergence** - exploration necessary
- Must empathize and understand other standpoints
- Distinguish collective intelligence (iteration) from crowdsourcing (aggregation)
- Must go from map-making to decision-making
- **Only possible with a goal**
- **Sense-making happens in practice, in action together**

**Doug's critique**: Anything modified by "collective" posits aggregate that doesn't exist, sets up for failure.

### Expansive vs Reductive Definitions

**Ken Homer's Yosemite story**

**Context**: Yosemite National Park workshop on conflict, 35 people

**Method**:
- 400+ words/phrases about "conflict" on post-its
- Arranged by bothersomeness (low to high)
- One person contributed: **"Organ failure"**
- Meaning: Conflict so bad might have heart attack

**Result**: After seeing it, everyone included "organ failure" in their understanding of conflict. Expanded shared meaning.

**Ken's principle**: "Let everyone say what they think, don't nail down to fine definition."

**Contrast**:
- **Expansive**: Exponentially synthetic, gathering meanings
- **Reductive**: Nailing down to single definition

**Marc-Antoine agreement**:
- "We're always arguing about words because we're arguing with words"
- "Negotiating shared meaning so we can have connection, communication, community"
- "Praxis of thinking with others - learning to listen, see other perspectives"
- "Don't expect formal definition to emerge or be agreed on"
- **"Illusion of consensus is terrible"** - we think we mean same thing, we don't

---

### Process vs Outcomes Tension

**Solution-oriented (Alex, Mike) vs Process-oriented (Marc-Antoine, Ken)**

**Mike**: Desperately need deadline or higher power pushing toward consensus

**Gil**: Premature attention to goals can get in the way of sense-making

**Marc-Antoine**: Sometimes you don't have common goal to start with, negotiating goal may be part of process

**Alex**: Solution-oriented, couldn't find thread without objective

**Alex's feedback** (important barometer): "I was lost, looking for objective. Solution-oriented people can feel lost in process-oriented discussions."

**Significance**: This tension IS the sense-making challenge - outcome people need concrete goals, process people need open exploration.

---

### OGM Reflection: Salon vs Bodies of Work

**Jerry's self-assessment**

**Jerry's concern**: "Characteristic of OGM: We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done."

**Other communities create**:
- Wikis
- Pattern languages
- Code
- Bodies of work

**OGM has**:
- Hardy crew showing up regularly
- Lovely conversations
- Occasional connections between people

**Mike's response**: "Several of us have used wisdom of this crowd to write very good stuff - look at broader ecosystem you've engendered."

**Gil's response**: "I don't come to OGM for sense-making (so carry on)."

**Contextual history**:
- Early OGM (2020-2021): Onboarding and outreach working groups started, then petered out
- Multiple standing calls (3-4/week) deprecated down to just Thursday
- Spin-off affinity groups existed but Jerry stepped out of them

**Significance**: Group questioning its own purpose and effectiveness - meta-awareness of limitations.

## Stories Shared

### Mike: WSIS Sense-Making Failure

**Summary**: World Summit on Information Society (Geneva/Tunis, 20+ years ago). No common goal: US wanted human rights, China wanted to water down declarations, Tehran/Syria guys wanted expense-paid Geneva trips. Complete consensus requirement allowed 1-2 people to hold all hostage. Failed spectacularly.

**Impact**: Example of sense-making failure when goals misaligned and bad process.

### Mike: 52 Monastery Beers Quest

**Summary**: Belgium has ~52 Trappist and abbey beers brewed by monks. Mike's lifetime goal to narrow to top 4. Some only available at monastery, some no longer made. "Ecumenical - will drink anything that's good."

**Impact**: Lighthearted opening about passion and lifetime goals.

### Ken: Yosemite Conflict Workshop - Organ Failure

**Summary**: 35 people, 400+ words for conflict, arranged by bothersomeness. "Organ failure" = conflict so bad might have heart attack. After seeing it, everyone included it in their understanding of conflict.

**Impact**: Perfect example of expansive shared meaning vs reductive definition. Illustrates the call's own dynamic.

### Alex: Last Week's Poem (Afraid So) - Wife's Reaction

**Summary**: Alex loved "Afraid So" poem from Call 04, sent to wife and kids. Kids said "great poem." Wife said "that's not a poem."

**Impact**: Perfect illustration of different interpretations/definitions. Gil: "Then it did its job."

## Poems

### "A Note Passed to Superman" by Lucille Clifton

**Shared by**: Ken Homer

**Opening**: "Sweet Jesus, Superman! If I'd seen you, dressed in your blue suit, I would have known you."

**Closing**: "You can trust me. There is no planet stranger than the one I'm from."

**Group reaction**: Jerry: "Beautiful. And that made perfect sense to everyone in the same way. Right?"

---

## Emotional Tone

Philosophical, meta, some frustration (Gil, Alex), appreciation for process (Marc-Antoine, Ken), humor throughout. Call demonstrated its own theme.

---

## Participation Notes

**Jerry Michalski**: Facilitator, tried to keep on frustrations before solutions, acknowledged OGM hasn't done much sense-making

**Gil Friend**: Challenged fundamental definitions - "what do we mean by sense?", frustrated with conversation, doesn't come to OGM for sense-making

**Mike Nelson**: IETF model expertise, UN negotiation war stories, monastery beers quest

**John Kelly**: Collective intelligence continuum - breakthrough vs motherhood statements

**Marc-Antoine Parent**: Collective intelligence frameworks, negotiating meaning as the work, defended process orientation

**Doug Breitbart**: "Collective" posits aggregate that doesn't exist, starts at Chapter 3 or 4 problem

**Alex Kladitis**: Solution-oriented, couldn't find thread, felt lost without objective, appreciated but didn't identify with discussion

**Ken Homer**: Expansive definitions story (Yosemite conflict workshop), closed with poem

**Rick Botelho**: Minimal, mentioned Weick's sense-making definition

**Kevin Jones**: Minimal participation

---

## Special Notes

- **Very meta call** - sense-making about sense-making
- **Gil's challenge "what do we mean by sense?" became central thread**
- **Process vs outcomes tension**: Marc-Antoine/Ken vs Alex/Mike
- Alex: Solution-oriented people can feel lost in process-oriented discussions (important feedback)
- Jerry didn't even get to planned questions about evidence of sense-making
- Humor: Should sense-making have a hyphen? Can we define "good poem"?
- Ken's Yosemite story exemplifies the call's own dynamic - expansive shared meaning
- **Call itself demonstrated the challenge it discussed** - perfect meta-illustration
- Call ended without resolving what sense-making is or whether OGM does it

---

## Cross-Call Connections

### Backward Connections

- **Call 03** - Disinformation as frustration for sense-making - can't make sense when people actively preventing it
- **Call 04** - Reality melting theme - if we can't agree on facts (Call 04), how do we make sense together (Call 05)?
- **Call 02** - Check-in format vs topical - this call questioned OGM's value

### Forward Connections

- **Call 07** - Collaboration definitions - continues definition debate pattern
- **Call 08** - Abundance definitions - Stacey's speed round format prevents extended debate
- **Call 09** - OGM meta-discussion about growth and platforms
- **Call 10** - Getting to common understanding (Doug's purpose)

### Thematic Connections

**Completes Batch 2: Reality Questioning** (Calls 04-06)

Call 05 meta-level: If reality is melting (Call 04), how do we make sense together? Group discovers making sense IS the challenge - no shared definitions, process/outcome tensions, salon vs bodies of work.

---

## Batch Context

**Batch 2 (Calls 04-06): Reality Questioning**

Call 05 escalates reality questions to meta-level. Pattern: Reality melting (Call 04) → Can't even agree how to make sense of melted reality (Call 05) → Need new approaches (Call 06 Klaus's AI pivot).
