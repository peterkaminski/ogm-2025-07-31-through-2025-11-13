## Thematic Batches

The 16 calls were analyzed in 6 thematic batches showing evolution of the group's concerns:

### Batch 1: Grounding (Calls 01-03)
**July 31 - August 14**

Foundation setting with Kevin's crisis as lived example of theoretical discussions:
- Call 01: Grief and societal trauma (theory)
- Call 02: Check-in (Kevin's real-time trauma worsening)
- Call 03: Information trust collapse in Gaza/Israel conflict

**Pattern**: Personal trauma (Kevin) mirrors societal trauma (information wars, climate disasters)

[Full Batch 1 Summary](../_artifacts/batch-01-summary.md)

### Batch 2: Systems Thinking (Calls 04-06)
**August 21 - September 4**

Reality itself becomes questionable in AI age:
- Call 04: Shared reality fracturing ("reality melting")
- Call 05: Definitional struggles ("what IS sense-making?")
- Call 06: Check-in with third places as resilience sites

**Pattern**: Group grappling with fundamental epistemological challenges - if we can't agree on reality or definitions, how do we make sense together?

[Full Batch 2 Summary](../_artifacts/batch-02-summary.md)

### Batch 3: Defining (Calls 07-09)
**September 11 - October 2**

Three major definitional deep dives:
- Call 07: What is collaboration? (vs teamwork, cooperation)
- Call 08: What is abundance? (vs scarcity mindsets)
- Call 09: What is OGM? (identity crisis - are we just "lovely salons"?)

**Pattern**: Group obsessed with precision of language and concepts - multiple calls spent purely on definition work

[Full Batch 3 Summary](../_artifacts/batch-03-summary.md)

### Batch 4: Interrogating (Calls 10-12)
**October 9 - October 23**

Technology interrogation escalates from practical to apocalyptic:
- Call 10: AI tools (practical - how to use in groups?)
- Call 11: Worldview challenges (worldviews as AI-like black boxes) + **Kevin's MIRACLE**
- Call 12: Has progress stopped? (vested interests blocking change)

**Pattern**: Technology skepticism intensifies. Also: Kevin Jones arc reaches PEAK with Mennonite miracle

[Full Batch 4 Summary](../_artifacts/batch-04-summary.md)

### Batch 5: Transforming (Calls 13-15)
**October 30 - November 13 Part 1**

Systemic solutions meet consciousness expansion:
- Call 13: Crony capitalism (three systemic solution approaches)
- Call 14: Jerry's psilocybin journey + non-local consciousness theory + AI bubble apocalypse
- Call 15: Curiosity Part 1 (Big Five Openness, selection bias, Excalidraw)

**Pattern**: Shift from external systems critique to internal consciousness expansion - maybe the problem requires transformed perception, not just better systems

[Full Batch 5 Summary](../_artifacts/batch-05-summary.md)

### Batch 6: Methodological Shift (Call 16)
**November 13 Part 2**

Single call completing two-part curiosity discussion:
- Call 16: Curiosity Part 2 with **methodological pivot**

**Victoria's Critique**: "We were explaining our hypotheses instead of asking questions"

**Proposal**: Question Formulation Technique for future OGM conversations
- Ask many questions without stopping to answer
- Prioritize top 3 questions
- Decide what to do with them

**Pattern**: Meta-level awareness - group realizes its own process might need fundamental shift from "explaining" to "questioning"
