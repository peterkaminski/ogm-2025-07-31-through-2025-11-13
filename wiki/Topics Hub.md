## Core Recurring Themes (5+ calls)

### AI and Technology (Calls 04, 10, 14, 15, 16)

**Evolution**: Practical tools → Epistemological crisis → Learning aids

**Call 04**: Reality melting - AI-generated content indistinguishable from human, photographic evidence no longer documentary
**Call 10**: AI as conversation participant - John Warinner's epiphany: "Why one-on-ones with ChatGPT instead of AI as group participant?"
**Call 14**: AI bubble consensus - Doug: "That's the end" (data centers), Pete: "weird territory past bubbles"
**Call 15**: Curiosity and AI - selection bias, Big Five Openness personality dimension
**Call 16**: AI learning breakthrough - Alex: ChatGPT lets him ask 50 times without shame, game-changer for comprehension differences

**Key Questions**:
- Can AI participate in group conversations, not just one-on-ones?
- How do we trust information when AI generates convincing fakes?
- Is AI making things better or worse? (enshittification)
- Can AI support learning for neurodivergent comprehension?

[Related: Enshittification, Reality Melting, Curiosity]

---

### Definitions and Sense-Making (Calls 05, 07, 08, 09, 12, 15)

**The group's recurring obsession with precise language and concepts**

**Call 05**: What IS sense-making? - Gil: "What do we mean by 'sense'?" Extended frustrating meta-debate
**Call 07**: Collaboration vs teamwork - Scott's precise framework, productive deep dialogue
**Call 08**: Abundance speed round - Stacey's innovation to avoid definitional spirals
**Call 09**: What IS OGM? - Meta-definition of the group itself
**Call 12**: What IS progress? - Immediate fragmentation on definition
**Call 15**: What IS curiosity? - Big Five Openness dimension, selection bias

**Pattern**: Group returns repeatedly to definitional questions, experiments with different methods

**Three Approaches**:
1. **Extended dialogue** (Call 07 collaboration) - Deep, productive when time allowed
2. **Speed round** (Call 08 abundance) - Collect diversity without forcing convergence
3. **Meta-discussion** (Calls 05, 09) - Turn lens on the definitional process itself

**Key Insight**: Ken Homer - expansive shared meaning vs reductive definition

[Related: OGM Identity, Methodology Innovation]

### Trust and Information (Calls 01, 03, 04, 11)

**Evolution**: Personal trust → Information trust → Reality trust → Worldview permeability

**Call 01**: Personal/community trust - East Germany paradox: low surface trust, deep underground trust
**Call 03**: Information trust crisis - Contradictory credible sources (Gaza), "brain defense" > media literacy
**Call 04**: Reality trust - "Reality melting" when AI makes everything fakeable
**Call 11**: Worldview trust - How do we handle news that doesn't fit our worldview? Al Chang's parallel narratives

**Key Frameworks**:
- Mike Nelson's "brain defense" (not media literacy)
- East Germany trust paradox (deep trust under pressure)
- Al Chang's parallel narratives (same facts, different movies)
- Jerry's AI steel-manning (using Claude/ChatGPT to understand opposing views)

**Major Questions**:
- How do we know what information to trust?
- Can we have shared facts without shared narratives?
- Do we allow our worldviews to be permeable?
- How do we steel-man opposing narratives?

[Related: Disinformation, Reality Melting, Worldview Challenges]

### OGM Identity and Purpose (Calls 05, 09, 14)

**The group examining itself**

**Call 05**: "Has OGM done sense-making or just salon conversations?"
**Call 09**: THE meta-call - "We have lovely salons, but we don't get a lot of things done"
  - Jerry's frustrated vision: "global mind" not happening
  - Alex's diversity testimony: "I don't agree with you guys, but that's what I value"
  - Platform frustration: no good tool answers
  - Historical attempts petered out (onboarding, Vincent Arena, Flotilla)
**Call 14**: Doug's revelation - **"OGM as gravitational center"**
  - 12 projects, 60% have OGM in common
  - Hidden impact as connector between initiatives
  - Jerry's vision validated: it IS happening, just differently

**Transformation**: Self-doubt ("lovely salons") → External validation ("gravitational center")

**Central Questions**:
- Is OGM a salon or should it create bodies of work?
- Do we want to grow? In what ways?
- What tool should new communities use?

**Preference**: Intimacy over scale (Jerry: one Zoom screen max ~64 people)
