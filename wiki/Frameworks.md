## Process & Methodology Innovations

### Question Formulation Technique (Call 16)

**Source**: Right Question Institute
**Introduced by**: Victoria (Spain)
**Call**: 16 (Nov 13 Part 2)

**The Four Rules**:
1. Ask as many questions as you can
2. Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss
3. Write down every question exactly as stated
4. Change any statements into questions

**Process**:
- Start with good focus question
- Play with questions (following four rules)
- Prioritize questions
- Decide what to do with top 3 questions
- **Does not end** with list of questions - ends when you decide action on top 3

**Victoria's Critique**: "We were explaining our hypotheses instead of asking questions"

**Success Story**: Greek mythology seminar
- **Before**: One person preparing theme, people would come with questions - nobody did
- **After**: Had so many questions, able to go in direction group wanted
- Some researched hero/heroine differences, others took different paths
- Each decided their own exploration
- **Result**: Instead of standardized sessions, enriched for everybody

**Significance**: Potential fundamental shift in OGM methodology from explaining to questioning

### Speed Round Format (Call 08)

**Introduced by**: Stacey Druss
**Call**: 08 (Sep 26 - Abundance)

**Purpose**: Collect diverse definitions without forcing convergence, avoid extended definitional spirals

**Process**:
- Rapid-fire contributions (30 seconds each)
- No discussion during collection
- Capture all perspectives
- Cluster afterward if needed

**Applied to**: Abundance definitions - collected 15+ perspectives

**Results**: Five clusters emerged naturally:
1. Sufficiency ("having what you need when you need it")
2. Generosity ("more than enough," "overflow")
3. Systems/regenerative ("self-renewing," "flourishing")
4. Psychological/spiritual ("state of mind," "lack of fear")
5. Relational ("being valued by others")

**Learning**: Deliberately collected diversity without forcing convergence

**Why Created**: After frustrating definitional spirals in Calls 05, 07, recognized need for alternative format

### Excalidraw Visual Collaboration (Call 15)

**Introduced by**: Victoria (Spain)
**Call**: 15 (Nov 13 Part 1 - Curiosity)

**Features**:
- Multi-user visual board
- Hand-drawn aesthetic
- Real-time collaboration
- Snapshot for safety

**Victoria's Approach**: "Instead of 'Education closes curiosity', state as question: 'Does education close curiosity?'"
- Gather all opinions
- Show we are not closing, but opening
- Questions instead of solutions to keep options open

**Philosophy**: Visual thinking + interrogative approach prevents premature closure

### The Mapping, Not the Map (Call 10)

**Source**: Gene Bellinger (via John Warinner)
**Call**: 10 (Oct 9 - AI as Participant)

**Core Insight**: Value is in the conversation process, not the final product

**Application**: AI tool discussions
- Don't optimize for perfect output
- Honor the exploratory journey
- Process over product

**Significance**: Reframes purpose of AI-assisted conversations - participation and discovery, not artifacts

[Related: Call 10](calls/Call-10.md) | [Topics Hub](Topics Hub.md#ai-as-conversation-participant)

## Conceptual Frameworks

### Third Places (Call 06)

**Source**: Eleanor Ostrom research (via Kevin Jones)
**Call**: 06 (Sep 4)

**Definition**: Informal gathering spaces beyond home (first place) and work (second place)

**Research Finding**: Watersheds managed 47% better when ranchers have regular meeting place

**Mechanism**: Third places enable community coordination through informal conversations

**Kevin's Application**: Creating third place for Swannanoa recovery
- No grocery, post office, hardware, restaurants - all gone after flood
- Need informal gathering space
- Informal meetings build trust → coordination

**Extended**: Low-status neighborhoods stay low-status after disasters (New Orleans 20 years later)

---

### Big Five Openness (Call 15)

**Source**: Personality psychology (Five Factor Model)
**Introduced by**: Scott Moehring
**Call**: 15 (Nov 13 Part 1)

**Definition**: Personality dimension measuring: creative, curious, open to new things

**Exists on spectrum**:
- High openness: Seek novelty, embrace change, explore ideas
- Low openness: Prefer routine, tradition, concrete thinking
- **Neither end evolutionarily better** - both have advantages

**OGM Pattern**: Group high in openness (selection bias)
- Everyone attending likely scores high
- Self-selection into group exploring ideas

**Application**: Explains group's definition obsession, curiosity about curiosity, methodological experimentation

[Related: Call 15](calls/Call-15.md) | [Topics Hub](Topics Hub.md#curiosity-and-epistemology)

---

### Intimacy Gradients (Call 16)

**Introduced by**: Jerry Michalski
**Call**: 16 (Nov 13 Part 2)

**Concept**: Concentric rings of social access
- Bedroom (most intimate)
- Living room
- Porch
- Block party (public)

**Cultural Variation**: Each culture, within each person, has different settings for who gets to be where

**Gil's Example**: Rural Maryland friend - 20 years before invited from porch into house
- Friendly conversations on porch
- But that's where it was

**Kevin's Examples**:
- Barcelona: Friends invited to cafes, not houses
- Tribal probing: "Fastest way to go slower with a tribe is to probe - they say they're going off to think, you wait"
- Camp protocol: "Don't get welcome to camp if you come into camp. You get visible. Wait. Get invited when time to invite you."

**Application**: Explains cultural differences in curiosity expression and questioning

### Al Chang's Parallel Narratives (Call 11)

**Source**: Jerry's friend Al Chang
**Call**: 11 (Oct 16 - Worldview Challenges)

**Framework**:
1. Set of facts on the ground
2. Left and right see roughly the same facts
3. But have **completely different movie scripts/narratives** around them
4. Both narratives are relatively consistent and work
5. Two sides **can't see or read each other's narratives** - incapable

**Jerry's Question**: "How do I steel man the opposing narrative? How do I put my brain into it and listen for different parts?"

**Jerry's Method**: Asked Claude and ChatGPT: "What has Trump actually done?" Discovered his people have been on the ground doing stuff that hasn't been done before in multiple places.

**Application**: Understanding political polarization, worldview challenges, cognitive dissonance

[Related: Call 11](calls/Call-11.md) | [Topics Hub](Topics Hub.md#worldview-challenges-and-narratives)

---

### Collaboration vs Teamwork (Call 07)

**Introduced by**: Scott Moehring
**Call**: 07 (Sep 11 - On Collaboration)

**Scott's Framework**:
- **Unique individuals** + **Shared vision identically articulated** + **Psychological safety**

**Distinction**:
- **Collaboration** = design, architecture, menu creation (inventing together)
- **Teamwork** = execution, coding, dinner rush (executing together)

**Restaurant Kitchen Example**:
- **Collaboration**: Creating the menu (chef, sous chef co-designing)
- **Teamwork**: Dinner service (everyone executing coordinated dance)

**Question**: Can you have collaboration without identical shared vision?

**Significance**: Precise definitional work enabling clearer communication

[Related: Call 07](calls/Call-07.md) | [Topics Hub](Topics Hub.md#collaboration-theory-and-practice)

### Remixability (Call 14)

**Introduced by**: Scott Moehring
**Call**: 14 (Nov 6)

**Source**: Kevin McLeod - most prolific composer you've never heard of
- 2,000 pieces of royalty-free music under Creative Commons
- One song played 31.6 billion times (TikTok, Facebook Reels)

**Concept Shift**: "Instead of making meals, make ingredients or recipes - things other people can and want to use to create things that are theirs"

**vs**: "Spending time creating something perfect and self-contained, never to be taken apart"

**Implication**: Create work that gives it a life of its own through remixing

**Application**: Open source philosophy, creative commons, collaborative knowledge

[Related: Call 14](calls/Call-14.md)

## Decision & Thinking Tools

### Brain Defense (Call 03)

**Introduced by**: Mike Nelson
**Call**: 03 (Aug 14 - Information Trust)

**Concept**: Better framing than "media literacy"

**Distinction**:
- **Media literacy**: Evaluating sources, fact-checking, critical reading
- **Brain defense**: Protecting cognition from manipulation, building mental immune system

**Why Better**: Focus on protecting yourself rather than evaluating everything
- Acknowledges information overload
- Emphasizes defense against manipulation
- Recognizes limits of fact-checking in disinformation era

**11 Ways to Fight Disinformation**: Mike identified 11 approaches - none work well

**Business Model Problem**: Profitable to spread disinformation, not to fight it

---

### Five Whys (Call 16)

**Introduced by**: John Kelly
**Call**: 16 (Nov 13 Part 2)

**Classic Technique**: Keep asking why, take apart each answer, don't accept as ultimate why

**Warning**: "Possible to over-focus on why when haven't done previous work about what and how"

**How vs Why**:
- **How** is more neutral version of why
- **Why** assumes motivation, human actor - good for mystery story
- Other kinds of collaborative coherence of causes you might not notice unless you said **how** instead of **why**, and **what** first

**Application**: Questioning techniques, root cause analysis

**Context**: John shared while in hyperbaric chamber (2 atmospheres, 46% oxygen!)

[Related: Call 16](calls/Call-16.md)

[Related: Call 13](calls/Call-13.md)

---

### Radical Transparency (Call 13)

**Introduced by**: Alex Kladitis
**Call**: 13 (Oct 30 - Crony Capitalism)

**Concept**: Make all lobbying, political influence, corporate power visible

**Theory**: Sunlight as disinfectant - expose mechanisms of influence

**Challenge**: Alex's Russia mob rule horror stories - "shamelessness, not even embarrassed"
- Transparency alone may not work if actors feel no shame
