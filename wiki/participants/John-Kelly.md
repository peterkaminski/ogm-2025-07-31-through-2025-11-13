## Major Contributions

### Hyperbaric Chamber Revelation (Call 16)

**Noticing**:
> "One ideas of curiosity was noticing things you don't absolutely have to notice. You may notice I'm in different context than earlier"

**Revelation**: "Actually in a hyperbaric chamber - just under 2 atmospheres, about 46% oxygen"

**Purpose**:
- Nominally therapeutic benefits for certain disease conditions
- Also as longevity or cognitive enhancement tool - that's how I'm using it

**Impact**: Most dramatic setting for participation in entire series

### Five Whys and Discovery Methods (Call 16)

**Five Whys**:
- Classic technique - keep asking why
- Take apart each answer, don't accept as ultimate why

**Over-Focus Warning**:
- Possible to over-focus on why when haven't done previous work about what and how
- How is more neutral version of why
- Why assumes motivation, human actor
- Good for mystery story, but other kinds of collaborative coherence of causes you might not notice unless you said how instead of why, and what first

**Militantly Uncurious Students**:
- Had plenty first-gen college, mill town
- Career goal to become shop teacher
- When started talking about communication, they said "When are we gonna laminate?"
- Had pictures of motorcycles they wanted to laminate
- "This is college"

**Social Context Solution**:
> "If you created a context where there's social reason for participating and pursuing question like five whys, they'll participate for social reason. Down the road, get benefit - 'oh, we actually discovered something we weren't looking for, wouldn't have done it if told to, but did it in context of playing this little game. Now have different perspective.'"

### Reputational Economy Framework (Call 13)

**Middle Territory**: Between economic and democratic systems

**Current Problems**:
- Economics world: transactions, measurement, gross ignoring of non-monetary values
- Democracy world: people express intentions, should have consequences, very fragile
- Reputational economies exist but problematic: social media followers, influencers

**Proposal**:
- Everyone has influence (not just votes), some have more than others but **BOUNDED**
- Cannot be taken down to zero influence
- Cannot have more than some maximum amount
- Earn social capital by contributing to community (NOT Chinese social credit way - no jaywalking penalties)
- NOT in hands of government or corporation - quasi-public entity
- Periodically fired at social problems (like civic assemblies)
- Isolate issue, select people based on their earned influence

**Impact**: Alternative governance/economy framework
