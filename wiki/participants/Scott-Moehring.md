## Major Contributions

### Big Five Openness Model (Call 15)

**Framework**: Statistically verified personality model

**Five Dimensions** (Openness is one):
- People who tend to be creative, interested in intellectual pursuits
- Open to new things and new ways
- Curious

**Spectrum**:
- Exists on spectrum - there are people low in openness
- Neither end evolutionarily better, which is why we have the spectrum

**Low Openness Value**:
- Sometimes need to be less open and more literal, practical
- Tradition, history, ritual important

**High Openness Value**:
- Sometimes need to be more open, accepting, combining, far-reaching

**OGM Bias**:
- "This group tends to be high in openness - room attracts those kinds of people"
- If looking for evidence of less curious, we're going to continue to notice instances where people are less curious

**Scott's View**: Haven't seen a sea change in that - believe it exists on a range

**Impact**: Provided scientific framework for curiosity discussion, explained OGM's selection bias

### Remixability Concept (Call 14)

**Kevin McLeod Example**:
- Most prolific composer you've never heard of
- 2,000 pieces of royalty-free music under Creative Commons
- One song played 31.6 billion times (TikTok, Facebook Reels)

**Concept Shift**:
> "Instead of making meals, make ingredients or recipes - things other people can and want to use to create things that are theirs"

**Vs**:
> "Spending time creating something perfect and self-contained, never to be taken apart"

**Implication**: Create work that gives it a life of its own through remixing

**Impact**: Introduced content creation philosophy - ingredients over finished products
