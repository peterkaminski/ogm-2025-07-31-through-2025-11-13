## Story Arc: From Testimony to Methodological Innovation

### Phase 1: Powerful Testimony (Call 01)

**Call 01** (July 31): One of the most significant moments of the entire series

**Gender Violence Testimony**:
- 80%+ violent crimes perpetrated by men
- Child trafficking and abuse networks
- Institutional protection of perpetrators
- Cultural silence and complicity
- Need for men to speak out in their circles

**Personal Context**:
- Marriage to "fight to win" husband who killed the family
- Ex-husband's win-at-all-costs mentality
- Stacey escaped
- Childhood memory: boy suffocating frogs - male violence normalized from childhood

**Context That Made It Harder**:
- Noted she was "only woman on call"
- Made her statement more vulnerable
- Demonstrated courage in speaking anyway

**Call to Action**:
- Men need to speak out in their own circles
- Cultural complicity must be addressed
- Institutional protection of perpetrators must end

**Framework Introduced**:
- 3 C's of processing: Choose, Connect, Communicate

### Phase 2: Present and Observing (Calls 02-07)

**Call 02**: Check-in participation
**Calls 03-04**: Present (details not captured in excerpts)
**Call 05**: ABSENT (only call missed)
**Calls 06-07**: Continued participation

**Pattern**: Stacey maintained consistent presence, building understanding of OGM's conversation patterns

---

### Phase 3: Methodological Innovation (Call 08 - September 26)

**THE TURNING POINT**: From content contributor to process designer

**Speed Round Exercise Proposed**:
- Format: "Quick title/phrase/headline/bumper sticker - what abundance IS only"
- Structure:
  - What it IS (not how/where/when/why)
  - Can say "pass"
  - Refrain from explaining initially
- Purpose: Get diverse definitions on table before discussion

**Why This Mattered**:
- OGM had struggled with definitional debates in Calls 05 and 07
- Speed round prevented extended definition spiral
- Got pithy, focused responses from everyone
- Jerry surprised "how early in call everyone was so focused"
- Format worked - "pithy and right on mission"

**Stacey's Definition of Abundance**:
- "Having what you need when you need it"

**Email Tone**:
- Closed with "Thank you for attention to this matter" with wink
- Mocking Trump Truth Social posts
- Playful authority

**Impact**: Demonstrated Stacey could diagnose OGM's process problems and create solutions

---

### Phase 4: Systems and Community (Calls 09-13)

**Call 09** (Oct 2): OGM Meta-discussion
- Participated in conversation about OGM's identity
- Valued Pete Kaminski's archive as "most valuable thing for her in OGM"
- Found something she wrote, brought it to different community
- Views everyone as "a page in her own book"
- Wants calls archived so can add pieces to "pages"
- Members are important - they go to different places, make up different groups
- Prefers OGM mailing list (knows audience) over Plex (no idea who reads)

**Insight**: Stacey sees OGM as resource for cross-pollination to other communities

**Call 13** (Oct 30): Crony Capitalism Discussion

**Community Belonging Framework**:
- Became condo association president
- Changed rule: contractor living in building became VP, allowed to do work
- Got family discount + showed contractor's discount on materials
- Built trust, saved money, contractor got work in his own home
- "Mental thing where we all belonged to the community"

**Mondamí Example**:
- 90,000 community members working together
- People say "theft!"
- Stacey: "When you feel something belongs to you and your community, even if you steal, you usually steal from outside your community"
- Human nature needs to be considered in system design

**Shamelessness Observation**:
- Two sectors where "good people say: 'You gotta work with bad people if you're gonna make it in this business'" - entertainment and finance
- "Always wants to throw up"
- Used to not hear this in government
- People afraid they'd be outed, held secrets over you
- NOW: "Secrets don't matter. There is no shame."
- Don't have to worry being outed because it's "fake news"
- Nobody believes anything

**Implication**: Transparency still necessary but harder to leverage when shame mechanism broken

---

### Phase 5: Curiosity and Noticing (Call 16 - November 13)

**Call 16**: Curiosity Discussion

**Noticing vs Curiosity Distinction**:
- "Little bit of blurry line between the noticing and the curious"
- **Fundamental statement**: "I just want to remind everybody, we are all curious" - just saying that
- **Noticing problem**: "Do believe there are people that just don't notice. May not have ability to notice. If you don't notice in first place, you can't be curious."
- **Then there's a distinction**: "Then there are people that notice and they're not curious - there's a difference there"

**Impact**: Added critical layer to curiosity discussion - prerequisite of noticing before curiosity can happen

**Jerry's Response**:
- "So much of all of this is about how we direct our attention, or how we mind our attention, or what we pay attention to - only that will direct us to be curious and give us the avenue"
