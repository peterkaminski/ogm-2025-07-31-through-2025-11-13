### Phase 6: One-Way Conversations (Call 15 - November 13, Part 1)

**MAJOR OBSERVATION**: Curiosity Discussion

**The Phenomenon**:
- "People much younger than me were not curious"
- Evidence: "Conversations where I would ask them questions, and they would not ask me questions - perplexing"
- Networking situations at conferences - "really struck at how one-way those conversations have been"

**New Strategy**:
- Started talking about things - "what I'm up to, doing, want to talk about, would have wanted to be asked about"
- Then conversation proceeds normally, interested, back and forth
- "But initiation, asking questions about somebody else, noticing it in its absence"

**The 55-Year-Old Friend Example**:
- Woman they've known since she was 12, now ~55
- Dinner few months ago, spent 3 hours together, lovely buffet, backyard
- "Didn't ask a single question of us - not 'How are you doing? How's your life? How's your health?'"
- Knows Jane (Gil's partner) has been going through major health issues for many years
- "Became increasingly uncomfortable, really baffled"
- "Didn't figure out what was weird until afterwards, never been in situation like that"
- **Significance**: "Challenges my assumption that it's a phenomenon of younger people - she's not young"

**Impact**: Identified significant social pattern - absence of reciprocal questioning
