## Major Contributions

### Cosplay Diplomacy Critique (Call 11)

**Concept**: Claims of stopping wars are temporary, lack substance, "cosplay" rather than real diplomacy

**Examples**:
- Armenia-Azerbaijan: temporary, not meaningful reconciliation
- Gaza: "deal" in NYC real estate sense (common goal, figure out details later), already falling apart
- Hamas explicitly said they didn't agree to disarm part of "deal"
- Afghanistan parallel: Trump talked to Taliban, not Afghan government, vague deal with no checks, timed withdrawal after he left office - Biden got "egg on his face" from incompetent deal

**Warning**: "Let's wait 5 years and look back. No diplomat would claim what Hamas half-agreed to is a final deal."

### Carnegie Scholar Shock (Call 11)

**Personal Worldview Challenge**:
- Two days before call: one of Carnegie's top analysts (Indian military/geopolitics) - house raided by FBI
- Found 1000+ top-secret/confidential documents
- Mike's favorite colleague
- Advisor to State Department, knows how to handle classified docs
- Stories emerging: is he a spy for Chinese? (not accused yet)
- Similar to Sandy Berger (Clinton's National Security Advisor) but much larger scale

**Mike's Reaction**:
> "Completely disconnect from everything I know about this scholar, makes no sense. Having very hard time dealing with it. Don't know how I will."

**Jerry's Response**: "Perfect example of ill-fitting news in our worldview."

**Impact**: Personal example that worldview challenges aren't just political
