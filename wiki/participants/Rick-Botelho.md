## Major Contributions

### Growth Question (Call 09)

**Critical Framing**:
- "Do you want to grow or not? If not, that's fine."
- Groups go through biorhythms - expansive then contracting
- OGM has contracted (fewer calls, fewer platforms)
- If want to grow, need deliberate onboarding (buddy system, etc.)

**Inside-Outside Dynamic**:
- Exists even in welcoming groups
- People on inside don't see it
- Newcomers experience it clearly

**Mycelial Nature Model**:
- Spin-off affinity groups model
- EXO AI group example:
  - Had fallout
  - Morphed, got new leadership
  - Now expanding

**Rick's Experience**:
- Metal men's group (left - apolitical, which was ironic because it wasn't really)
- Had ~50 different subgroups (clustering, infinities, crypto, etc.)
- Incredible to see breadth of affinity groups
- Self-organizing, self-generating, self-governing spin-off groups

**Impact**: Provided organizational models for OGM's growth question

### Co-Intelligence Abundance (Call 08)

**Definition**: "Co-intelligence"

**Context**: Speed round on abundance definitions

**Implication**: Abundance as relational/collective, not individual
