## Major Contributions

### "Weird Territory Past Bubbles" (Call 14)

**Big Picture**:
- "Been in a bubble since about PC era - one big tech bubble inflation thing going up and down, changing world and us"
- AI as endgame: "Feels like some kind of endgame"
- Either: amazing productivity and social justice
- Or: crash hard because we've turned all matter into GPUs
- Likely outcome: "Some weird thing in the middle"

**Past Bubbles**:
> "It's hard to say this out loud to professional people who care, but it feels like we're kind of post cash/gold/Bitcoin questions"

**Weird Territory**:
> "All of that seems like the wrong questions at this point. We're passed where we've even thought about bubbles. We're in weird territory."

**AI Backstop Question**:
- Will AI backstop you? Won't it?
- Maybe great, but won't be able to eat
- Need to apply AI to growing things, delivering food, regenerative soil

**Impact**: Named the epistemological territory OGM was in - past normal bubble questions

### AI Safety Warnings (Call 16)

**Pete's Approach**:
- Using ChatGPT for health advice
- Knows health systems, medicine, how it works
- Can ask penetrating questions: "Are you sure you thought about this or that?"
- Feels safe to navigate

**Warning**:
> "Wouldn't recommend to most people. Don't do it at home."

**Washington Post Concern**:
- Shocking reading about people using these technologies with no clue how it works
- Getting tricked - not because thing trying to trick
- But in context where don't have enough information

**Response to Alex's AI Learning**:
- Alex shared AI as learning breakthrough
- Louise (teacher) got concerned from Pete's warning
- Pete providing safety framework vs Alex's enthusiasm

**Impact**: Balanced AI optimism with safety concerns

### Platform and Tool Management (Call 09)

**Mattermost Deprecation**:
- Pete shutting down Mattermost
- Had been hosting for OGM
- Part of platform simplification

**Archive Value**:
- Stacey: "Pete's archive was most valuable thing for her in OGM"
- Found something she wrote, brought it to different community
- Archive enabled cross-pollination

**Plex Goal**:
- "Who's doing what where? Help people find out more."
- Felt marginally successful, mostly failed
- Devilishly difficult to get that information from people
- Not because closed-lipped, but context-dependent
- Vincent Arena example: doing amazing stuff, no time to sit around and share
- Missing global "matchmaking function"
- Didn't track readership, didn't want to categorize people
- Wanted to give people agency, not assume collective categorization
- Pete no longer publishing Plex, Kevin is (with different conception)

**Publish and See Who Complains**:
- Heuristic for discovery
- Make what you know public, learn from responses
- Iterative discovery method

---

### Sheaf Methodology (Call 14)

**Mentioned in check-in**:
- Alex interested in learning more
- Not fully described in call
- Pete's methodological contribution

---

### Wiki Vision (Call 09)

**Historical Context**:
- Pete co-founded SocialText (wiki company)
- Pete and Jerry thought years ago we'd all collaborate through wikis
- Semi-structured wikis (Wagon and variants) came and went
- Vision: rhizomal mycelial network of connected text nodes
- MassiveWiki isn't quite a wiki yet - can't click to edit page you're looking at
- That's important feature for wikis

**Critique**:
- Don't have wiki-like conversation yet in (ironically) OGM Wiki
