## Major Contributions

### Question Formulation Technique (Call 16)

**Source**: Right Question Institute methodology from some years ago

**Proposal**: "I think we need to do something like that - with good focus question, start asking questions first"

**Four Rules**:
1. Ask as many questions as you can
2. Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss
3. Write down every question exactly as stated
4. Change any statements into questions

**Process**:
- Playing with questions, prioritize, then decide what to do
- Ends with prioritizing questions and deciding what to do with top 3

**Greek Mythology Example**:
- Informal seminar among people interested in Greek mythology
- Original: One person preparing theme, people would come with questions - nobody did
- After technique: Had so many questions, able to really go in direction we wanted
- Lists of questions, prioritize them, decide what to do
- Some: "I want to research the hero/heroine difference, I want to go through this other path"
- Instead of standardized sessions, really enriched for everybody

**Critique of OGM**:
> "I love the conversation, I've learned a lot. But I don't think we have really start to uncover half of what curiosity is about. Because we were explaining our hypotheses instead of asking questions"

**Impact**: Proposed methodological transformation for future OGM calls

### Excalidraw Curation (Call 15)

**Setup**:
- Created multi-user Excalidraw board with hand-drawn aesthetic
- Took snapshot copy so "if everything is messed, it doesn't matter"

**Approach**:
- Instead of "Education closes curiosity", state as question: "Does education close curiosity?"
- Opens more things to work with
- Positing multiple theories instead of choosing one to close it down
- Gather all opinions but show we are not closing, but opening

**Themes**:
- Issue of access links to books as "fossil knowledge" (trapped)
- Silos, academia paid subscriptions
- A lot of things going on

**Proposal**: "Gather everything and start thinking how this relates to different OGM projects, or different things that can start from here"

**Excalidraw Continuation**: "Can be opened longer, anybody who wants to continue conversation there, that would be great"
