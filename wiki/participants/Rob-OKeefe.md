**Shutdown Coming**:
- End of September
- Most think it will happen

### Storytelling vs AI

**Daughter**:
- Sophomore at NYU film school
- Top jobs AI will replace - but world needs storytellers
- Already sick of AI-generated stuff, appreciation for authentic art
- Interested in documentaries, watches few movies, loves Broadway

**New York Energy**:
- Unmatched - all economic statuses co-mingled
- Concentrations of artists, musicians, restaurants, creativity

**Thesis**: World needs storytellers regardless of tools - authentic art vs AI-generated

**Early Backlash**: Already sick of AI-generated stuff

### Headlines vs Reality

**Examples**:
- DC crime-ridden (not true)
- NYC crime-ridden (not true)
