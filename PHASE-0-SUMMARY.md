## Preliminary Observations

### Strengths of This Call Series:
- Diverse topics covering technology, society, philosophy, practice
- Mix of intellectual discussion and personal sharing (check-ins)
- Long-term participant relationships (mentioned "six-year journey")
- Willingness to tackle complex, nuanced topics
- Integration of guest speakers and perspectives

### Challenges for Wiki Creation:
- High topic diversity may require extensive cross-linking
- Check-in content needs careful separation from topical content
- Some calls very meta (about OGM itself) vs content-focused
- Platform transitions create organizational complexity
- Nov 13 two-part call needs special handling for numbering

### Unique Features:
- Blend of check-in and topical calls
- Poetry readings (Ken's tradition)
- AI summaries available for 15/16 calls
- Rich discussion of community practices alongside external topics
- Explicit discussion of communication norms and practices
