00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.200
Jerry Michalski: This is the OGM Weekly Call for Thursday, October 23rd, 2025.

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.430
Jerry Michalski: Our topic today is, has progress stopped? And I was just starting down that path when I realized I hadn't turned on the recording, so now it's on.

3
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:26.950
Jerry Michalski: But there's some obvious questions like, hey, we're not flying any faster or traveling any faster than we did in the 1950s.

4
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.910
Jerry Michalski: what's up with that? There are other cultural questions. I was pointing to Ted Joya, who has really interesting.

5
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:48.060
Jerry Michalski: essays about popular culture and how the infinite scroll seems to be eating thoughtful culture, etc, etc, and I think we'll find other angles to put into the conversation as we go here.

6
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.719
Jerry Michalski: So, let me go with Alex.

7
00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:01.469
Alex Kladitis: Hi, sorry, I had to speak up on this, because I think we're going to go down the intellectual route, and I do believe that one of the factors is

8
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.689
Alex Kladitis: That… With the way we have progressed, our civilization has progressed.

9
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.090
Alex Kladitis: There are so many Big interests that actually are beginning to work against

10
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:25.420
Alex Kladitis: progress. The exception is computing, IT, for some reason that has bucked the trend. But I would argue that if anything came out tomorrow.

11
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.460
Alex Kladitis: that… The best battery there ever was that would solve all the problems.

12
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:44.290
Alex Kladitis: the oil industry and the governments, and everybody will say it was too much impact to the economy of the world, therefore we'll buy it out, and that would be the end of it. So there's a… there's now an overweight…

13
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.309
Alex Kladitis: kind of… hegemonic Interests in the world economy.

14
00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:06.219
Alex Kladitis: that are actually, in certain ways, suppressing progress, if the progress is going to be massive, disruptive, etc. And I know I've discussed this with many other people, and they'll say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, Alex, or whatever. But I actually think that's part of the cycle.

15
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.949
Alex Kladitis: Anyway, I just want to put that in before we go the intellectual route, which is also a very good route to go.

16
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:30.869
Jerry Michalski: I think that, you know, vested interests and the economics of progress are somewhat intellectual. I mean, they're not emotional, in the sense of it's not, you know, coming from some very different place. It's just a piece of the analysis, I think. So I paraphrased what you just said badly, probably, in the chat.

17
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.910
Jerry Michalski: Vested interests will kill most progress, that people who have, you know, whose golden goose will be killed.

18
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.129
Jerry Michalski: We'll make sure that any novel thing that endangers their business will not thrive? Is that what you mean?

19
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.369
Alex Kladitis: Yes, that's what I mean, yes

20
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.260
Alex Kladitis: And they're big enough to do it now.

21
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.240
Jerry Michalski: And we've…

22
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.389
Jerry Michalski: And we've seen plenty of things like this. I'll point to a favorite old example, which is the Great American Streetcar Conspiracy.

23
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.690
Jerry Michalski: in which, American… General Motors,

24
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.580
Jerry Michalski: Firestone, Phillips66, and Mack Truck wanted to sell bus…

25
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:14.930
Jerry Michalski: more buses in the US, so they bought up most of the light rail lines, which existed and were thriving, and then slowly turned down service and then shut down the lines.

26
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.920
Jerry Michalski: And because they realized that once you've pulled up the rails and burned the cars, nobody's gonna go install a brand new light rail line, and as a result, we have car culture, not…

27
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.150
Jerry Michalski: public transit culture, and we struggle. You know, Portland has what I consider an extremely wimpy.

28
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:40.039
Jerry Michalski: light rail system that kind of makes it around, and, you know, it's not good. And then you go to Berlin, and you drop in, or you go to any major international.

29
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.970
Mike Nelson: city.

30
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.180
Jerry Michalski: And you drop in, and you're like, OMG.

31
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.410
Rick Botelho: They have layers and layers of public transit, which is running all the time really snappy, and is, you know.

32
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.929
Jerry Michalski: Very serviceable, so…

33
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.760
Mike Nelson: I thought the tire companies were involved, too.

34
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.680
Jerry Michalski: Firestone.

35
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.729
Mike Nelson: Yeah. Oh, you did say that, okay.

36
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.589
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, and they got found for antitrust, but it was too late because blah blah blah. I mean, you know, the government found against them.

37
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.650
Jerry Michalski: the whole thing. Gil, please.

38
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.269
Jerry Michalski: And you're…

39
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.369
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Sorry, you were muted, but no, you're not. Good. Gotta hit some toggles.

40
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.410
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So I think there's a question behind your question, Jerry, of what is progress.

41
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.660
Jerry Michalski: Yes, which, which Victoria asked in the chat.

42
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.160
Rick Botelho: Yeah.

43
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:41.779
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I had asked in the chat above, and Pete thought I was asking the wrong question, but several of us were interested in going in that direction, number one. Number two, the example of transportation in European cities is… calls into question whether the lack of progress in the United States is about the lack of progress of humanity.

44
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:50.079
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Progress may be highly localized. And, it seems to me there's progress in lots of areas. Do I have screen share?

45
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.420
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'll show you something?

46
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.480
Jerry Michalski: It's set by default for everybody.

47
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.030
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Okay, let me just see if I can pop this open real quickly here.

48
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:12.310
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Because if we look at, you know, if we look at things like energy transition, renewable energy, progress of the price and performance of renewable energy over the past 20, 30 years has been striking.

49
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:26.099
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And, we are now… we now have more renewable energy being generated on the planet than coal-generated energy, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So there's, you know, there's… there's progress in some dimensions there. Let's see, desktop here…

50
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:37.809
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: For example, you know, stuff like that. So that would argue that there is progress, although, you know, climate degradation is proceeding apace, environmental degradation proceeding apace.

51
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.090
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: personal in our lives, I'm looking at medical progress, and I have a wife who would not be alive.

52
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:52.149
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: without certain kind of cancer research that's happened. I mean, in remission from a disease that, when she was first diagnosed, we were told, we were told would kill her in 2 years.

53
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.660
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And she's now 11 years in and in remission.

54
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.170
Jerry Michalski: Wow. So I gotta, I gotta count that as progress.

55
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.690
Jerry Michalski: Yep.

56
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.860
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, so back to my… so my starting question is, when you say, you know, is progress ended, it's like, what do you mean by progress?

57
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.869
Jerry Michalski: Which is a great question to ask. I will say that

58
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.349
Jerry Michalski: How our energy is generated happens behind the curtain.

59
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:36.249
Jerry Michalski: And so we don't necessarily see it, and the electricity that shows up at the socket is the same electricity that showed up at the socket at 1950, so there's no perceived difference to our daily lives the way there would be if supersonic airplane travel had taken over. It would be like, oh my gosh, you can get to London in 2 hours instead of, you know, 9.

60
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:47.500
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: although I now have an induction range, so I have a better cooking experience and less toxic pollution in my house and less fire risk with the same electricity. And the electricity comes from my roof.

61
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:58.730
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: with a backup battery that switches over in microseconds if there's a power outage. So, yeah, it's the same electrons, but the overall experience is certainly better for me.

62
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.280
Jerry Michalski: And the electrons are having a much better time of it, so…

63
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.089
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I hope so.

64
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.100
Jerry Michalski: That's good.

65
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:14.289
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, point being, Jerry, that… so there's several layers of interpretation happening in this conversation, and I'd like to open them up and have them be.

66
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.759
Rick Botelho: Oh my god.

67
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.070
Jerry Michalski: I… that sounds great, and if you would like to step back in and propose…

68
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:28.209
Jerry Michalski: progress framework, some way we can kind of look at and separate out these things, that would be cool. I mean, I'm into that exploration, that sounds great.

69
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:45.830
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm going to hold off on that and ask you what you… because you raised the question, what do you mean by progress? Give us a, you know, a framing or contextual definition of how that lives in you, because there's… you clearly have a strong, you know, you have interpretations and strong feelings about this, but let us… let us inside your brain case.

70
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.029
Jerry Michalski: That's funny. I…

71
00:07:48.090 --> 00:08:03.259
Jerry Michalski: don't think I'm a proponent for the notion that progress has died. I am definitely not in that camp. I am provoking the conversation here intentionally with the notion that we all kind of broaden out what we mean by it, what examples of it stand out for us, and so forth.

72
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:16.820
Jerry Michalski: And I think the place I'll go to is the superficial end of progress, which is the dramatic ways in which people's lives have been affected. So, our grandparents likely lived through electrification.

73
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:35.549
Jerry Michalski: And their parents probably lived through a hygiene revolution, and so on and so forth, things that were major. You know, when the outhouse goes away, and you have running water, and it's clean, and you get less sick, and all that, those are really pretty large things. And there may not be…

74
00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:46.140
Jerry Michalski: large changes like that left? I doubt that, sincerely. It may be that AI takes us through the next large change like that, and we're living through it this very instant. That's an interesting proposition.

75
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:53.120
Jerry Michalski: But yeah, so… so Gil writes in the chat, so progress as transformation of daily life. I think that's one

76
00:08:53.120 --> 00:09:10.839
Jerry Michalski: superficial way of looking at it, but when people ask, where is my flying car, that's kind of what they're asking. It's like, hey, I expected by now that I could, you know, or maybe I could hit a button on my phone like I do for Uber, and a hexacopter would land in my backyard and take me anywhere I want in the city. By now. Well, heck, where is it?

77
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.999
Jerry Michalski: And maybe that's not it. And maybe…

78
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:22.139
Jerry Michalski: Don't get me started on the word civilization, because if we go back to the dawn of everything and a bunch of other angles here.

79
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:28.879
Jerry Michalski: You know, technological progress and economic progress tends to be at the cost of

80
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:35.630
Jerry Michalski: a whole bunch of other things that we may value more, that progress might actually be a relentment on

81
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:49.239
Jerry Michalski: pushing technology on us that gets us addicted, that this, that, that, that, the other, that progress might, in fact, be something entirely different. So I'm open to anybody who wants to wave that flag in this conversation, because I probably feel stronger about that.

82
00:09:49.260 --> 00:10:01.469
Jerry Michalski: than I do about, where's my flying car, because I don't particularly want urban airscapes, littered with, drones and air taxis and all this other kind of stuff, because

83
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.580
Jerry Michalski: A fender bender at your corner is something that the rest of the city can ignore.

84
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:13.539
Jerry Michalski: A couple of, you know, quadcopters crashing into each other and dropping into a neighborhood is not something that's easy to ignore.

85
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.579
Jerry Michalski: Like that.

86
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.700
Jerry Michalski: Mr. Nelson.

87
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.089
Mike Nelson: I'm gonna be… Provocative and obnoxious, and say.

88
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.150
Doug Breitbart: Excellent.

89
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:39.149
Mike Nelson: rewrite this question. I mean, we have already been diverted 10 minutes by talking about what is progress, and that's… I mean, it's just not useful. I mean, all of us have different definitions. I've got at least 5.

90
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.150
Mike Nelson: I would…

91
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:48.410
Mike Nelson: Actually propose we narrow to something that we might actually be able to talk about for an hour and make some progress on.

92
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.330
Mike Nelson: And that is… Are there more barriers?

93
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.170
Mike Nelson: to technological development.

94
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.850
Mike Nelson: I mean, when I hear the word progress, I can say, okay, well, That's…

95
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.769
Mike Nelson: Are we having more scientific and research discoveries?

96
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:17.619
Mike Nelson: And then the second part is, are we applying those discoveries in cool, exciting new technologies?

97
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.240
Mike Nelson: And then there's…

98
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:26.600
Mike Nelson: Are there economic barriers that actually prevent us from using those cool technologies, like the super battery example?

99
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.770
Mike Nelson: And then there's a whole other line of progress, which is, are we building our societies in better ways? And I would say that

100
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.630
Mike Nelson: progress towards a better American democracy.

101
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.949
Mike Nelson: is not gonna happen for the next 3 years. And we can have a whole discussion about

102
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.569
Mike Nelson: Societal progress and evolution of governance systems.

103
00:11:50.690 --> 00:12:08.540
Mike Nelson: But I just… I mean, your question is so broad, wide open, we're gonna all talk past each other. Each of us will make our contribution, and then the next person will say something different, and… because we're all coming from a different place of what progress we think is most important.

104
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.660
Mike Nelson: I mean, we could go straight to the output, right, and say.

105
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.420
Mike Nelson: The improvement in the quality of daily life.

106
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.810
Mike Nelson: That we have seen for the last 200 years.

107
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.359
Mike Nelson: is plateauing or ceasing. I mean, that would be a very provocative thing, and…

108
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.640
Mike Nelson: I would argue against that, if we took a global perspective.

109
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:41.529
Mike Nelson: I think here in the U.S, the quality of life is not doing very well, partly because we're amusing ourselves to death, and we're all

110
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:49.549
Mike Nelson: dealing with so many conflicting demands for our time, and… and what I… and what,

111
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.779
Mike Nelson: Dilbert used to call Confusopoly.

112
00:12:52.980 --> 00:13:00.500
Mike Nelson: These companies are throwing so many options at us, and they're… they're constantly trying to confuse

113
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:08.400
Mike Nelson: what the product is that we're paying for, and how much we pay. I mean, we just don't have time to sort through the crap.

114
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:21.200
Mike Nelson: And they won't answer the phone when we call them. So that's a whole other thing about customer service, and there's… I think… I think despite the new AI tools, these call centers are…

115
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:29.820
Mike Nelson: doing a better job of diverting you away from your end goal than getting you there. That's a very niche example of progress.

116
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:40.279
Mike Nelson: But, there's just too many things that we could talk about with your question, so I would propose a counter question, which is, are there more barriers

117
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.290
Mike Nelson: too technological.

118
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.070
Mike Nelson: improvement.

119
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.850
Mike Nelson: Than in the past.

120
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.339
Mike Nelson: And I would throw two things out, if you haven't seen them.

121
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.319
Mike Nelson: Corey Doctorow's new book, In Shitification.

122
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.510
Mike Nelson: is directly.

123
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:15.020
Mike Nelson: on this question about why can't we have good things? Why aren't technological breakthroughs leading to customer service breakthroughs and quality of life improvements? And then the other one is a deeper and actually more important book called Breakneck.

124
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.630
Mike Nelson: And the subtitle says it all.

125
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.790
Mike Nelson: How China is engineering our future.

126
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:32.909
Mike Nelson: And the one-line summary that every book review has mentioned is, China… is a… Society run by engineers.

127
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.910
Mike Nelson: who build things.

128
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:44.330
Mike Nelson: America has evolved into a… Lawyer… Lawyerly culture that obstructs things.

129
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.000
Mike Nelson: And it, it's… It's coming more true every day.

130
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.099
Mike Nelson: Long screed, I hope that's a helpful suggestion.

131
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.439
Mike Nelson: See where it goes.

132
00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.530
Mike Nelson: And thanks for raising a very important issue. I just… I think we need to…

133
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.499
Jerry Michalski: Good. So, I… I…

134
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:24.450
Jerry Michalski: I empathize with your feeling that the topic was too broad. I think our MO tends to be, I throw a fish on the table, and then we sort of take different stabs and swings at it, and see where it goes, and we end up in something that we generally like and sort of settle into. And I'm unclear that everybody else on the call wants to talk about technological progress.

135
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.050
Jerry Michalski: Which is kind of, kind of why I framed it really broadly.

136
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:37.629
Jerry Michalski: And by the way, if any of you have followed the Peter Thiel and the Antichrist thread, which I followed last week, to my sort of chagrin, dismay, and great interest.

137
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:56.270
Jerry Michalski: it's crazy. He's… I think he's saying, and I believe Peter Thiel believes, that anybody who throws a barrier in front of, you know, AGI and superintelligence from these new devices and other kinds of progress is the Antichrist and should be dealt with accordingly, which is a little…

138
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.190
Jerry Michalski: frightening. I will…

139
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.370
Jerry Michalski: We'll post a link to that in my brain. There's a bunch of great articles about that.

140
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.049
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, Confusopoly now has a Wikipedia page, which is nice.

141
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.310
Jerry Michalski: Victoria.

142
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.580
Victoria (Spain): I was thinking… something similar to Mike.

143
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.830
Victoria (Spain): But in another completely different dimension, because…

144
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.679
Victoria (Spain): Progress comes from what we have imagined as a future.

145
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:34.049
Victoria (Spain): And the French writer Jules Bernet, the author of 80 Days Traveling the World in Balloon, this kind of…

146
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:44.209
Victoria (Spain): He… Forso, or… He gave us a framework to look forward.

147
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.860
Victoria (Spain): So, who is imagining our futures?

148
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:56.330
Victoria (Spain): Who are now playing this role of imagining possible outcomes for the future.

149
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:07.849
Victoria (Spain): Because everything I see nowadays, it's AI, AI, AI, Outspace colonies, immortality.

150
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.489
Victoria (Spain): And maybe the metaverse, or something like that?

151
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.159
Victoria (Spain): And all the narratives are very dark, like Black Mirror.

152
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:24.699
Victoria (Spain): So, the people imagining our futures are painting them really black.

153
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:35.960
Victoria (Spain): And maybe it's not only because the governments, the laws in the Americas, laws in Europe.

154
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.180
Victoria (Spain): Because we also have very restrictive laws.

155
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:48.250
Victoria (Spain): Maybe it's also because we ourselves are Fearing what we have done.

156
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.540
Victoria (Spain): That was my reflection.

157
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.070
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, thank you.

158
00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:05.169
Jerry Michalski: You're so right, so many of the visions that were being given are bleak, or whacked, like the, like Zuckerberg's metaverse.

159
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:15.629
Jerry Michalski: flavors. It's interesting, you just reminded me that we had a call in 2021 called Our Desirements for a Better Verse. I'll put a link to it in the chat.

160
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.410
Jerry Michalski: where…

161
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:29.569
Jerry Michalski: I think it came out of someone in this group talking about desirements. I think, was it Scott? It was somebody who sort of coined desirements, which was… seemed like a lovely phrase. And,

162
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:37.579
Jerry Michalski: we tried to talk about this notion of what… how would we imagine something better? So I actually bought the domain thebetterverse.com, I think? What is it?

163
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.590
Jerry Michalski: There we go.

164
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:55.719
Jerry Michalski: TheBetaverse.org, which I don't think I've put much on, but I will post it into, into the chat. And that was a lovely conversation, because we were trying to say.

165
00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:07.050
Jerry Michalski: what is a better vision for our future? And I'm sad that Hank Kuna is not on this call. He's based in Amsterdam. He is currently with his wife in Thailand, having a very nice time going around the country.

166
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.959
Jerry Michalski: We're in some time off.

167
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:17.560
Jerry Michalski: But Hank has spent most of his career helping, ordinary citizens develop, and children, and sort of mixed generations and so forth.

168
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:23.809
Jerry Michalski: helping them all develop visions of the future and articulate them and share them with each other, which I think is a…

169
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:29.610
Jerry Michalski: an interesting notion, and its own little ball of complexity. But, thank you.

170
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.120
Jerry Michalski: Pete, please.

171
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:50.350
Pete Kaminski: Thanks. Thanks, Jerry. It's an interesting, provocative question. Mike, I… I hear your, suggestion, and I actually don't find Jerry's,

172
00:19:50.610 --> 00:20:01.799
Pete Kaminski: Jerry's provocation to be disruptive or distributive or something like that. For me, the point of it is actually to have a messy discussion about

173
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:08.449
Pete Kaminski: what is progress? Who wants what? You know, how would I define it? How would you define it? How would we define it?

174
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.559
Pete Kaminski: So, so let me talk about what I…

175
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:35.780
Pete Kaminski: think about progress a little bit. I would say that… that humanity, humans have kind of ebbed and flowed with progress over the past 10,000, 20,000 years. it's nice that I never have to worry about being fed, unless I lose my income and… and then

176
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:46.449
Pete Kaminski: You know, aren't supported by my weird society that doesn't really want to help people who are less fortunate or something than the rest of us.

177
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:58.130
Pete Kaminski: And, you know, that's not true 5,000 years ago. It might have been something really, really, difficult to do, making sure that I got enough calories and enough protein and enough water every day.

178
00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:10.909
Pete Kaminski: But on the other hand, I live in a society where we're all very isolated from each other. We have these very small communities, tight-knit communities. The nuclear family thing is…

179
00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:16.230
Pete Kaminski: is dumb. You know, I should be living in a… in a…

180
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:36.040
Pete Kaminski: you know, in a place where I'm surrounded by 100 people I really love and get along well with, and then that group of us should be surrounded by 100 communities, each about the same size, all kind of living in harmony, et cetera, et cetera, right? So…

181
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.250
Pete Kaminski: you know, depending on… I… so I'm a little bit…

182
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:49.489
Pete Kaminski: I'm a little bit surprised that we're talking about economic progress, or technological progress, or things like that.

183
00:21:50.040 --> 00:22:08.989
Pete Kaminski: or societal progress. You know, I wouldn't judge that a million-person city is a great advance over a thousand-person village from a thousand years ago, you know? I mean, there's some awesome things about it. You know, museums or…

184
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:19.810
Pete Kaminski: Whatever, culture stuff. But there's a bunch of bad stuff, too, and… and… And,

185
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:42.559
Pete Kaminski: on the flip side, another thing I'm surprised about is that we… I think we narrowed down on human progress very quickly. For me, what I care about is things like equity and opportunity agency for all living beings, not just humans.

186
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:55.420
Pete Kaminski: And minimizing pain and suffering, especially pain and suffering inflicted on one to another. So, we live in a world where we have these things called concentrated animal feeding operations, where

187
00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:10.359
Pete Kaminski: I am aghast that humans can even live on the planet with themselves with, subjugation and torture of other, you know, living beings for their pleasure and benefit, you know? And it's like…

188
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.149
Pete Kaminski: what the heck are we doing? And this is something that, you know, is a modern…

189
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:27.560
Pete Kaminski: progress, from 100 years ago, or 200 years ago, or 1,000 years ago. And I… I can't even imagine, like, I'm… I'm embarrassed every time I think about it, you know?

190
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:38.889
Pete Kaminski: oh my god, we think we're having progress over the past couple hundred years, and this is where we have ended up. And that's kind of one, you know, little thing. You know, we have…

191
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:51.699
Pete Kaminski: a kind of progress and a kind of regression, in the way that we govern ourselves. You know, the… it comes and goes, but right now, I think we're doing a really bad job of

192
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.530
Pete Kaminski: of…

193
00:23:54.310 --> 00:24:05.979
Pete Kaminski: selecting a leadership organization for the United States. And, you know, is that progress where we are with the current administration? I don't think so.

194
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.120
Pete Kaminski: So…

195
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:20.009
Pete Kaminski: I guess in general, it's, it's interesting. I… I love the question, you know, is, has progress stopped?

196
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:37.320
Pete Kaminski: I… and… and kind of in answer, I think there's progress and regression in lots of different ways. And… and I think… I wish people… I wish humans paid more attention to non-humans, and progress for them as well.

197
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.350
Pete Kaminski: Thanks.

198
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.590
Jerry Michalski: Thank you very much.

199
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.649
Jerry Michalski: Hey Scott, our topic today is, has progress stopped?

200
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.849
Jerry Michalski: And, we're going around on that in different kinds of ways.

201
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.830
Scott Moehring: Are we going around, or are we raising hands? I don't want to jump in.

202
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:08.590
Jerry Michalski: We've been raising hands, and there's a gap in the hand raise just now, which is why I said hi to you.

203
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.649
Jerry Michalski: and, so we've been,

204
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:23.200
Jerry Michalski: Putting a whole bunch of things, and part of it is, like, we're trying to adjust the lens and figure out, like, how big is the aperture of what we want to talk about, and what are we going to focus on, and so forth.

205
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.260
Scott Moehring: I have a perspective on it, which is why I jumped in. I was hoping this would be the subject.

206
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.199
Jerry Michalski: That sounds great, and we would love to hear your perspective.

207
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:42.619
Scott Moehring: Excellent. So, a couple years ago, I did a deep dive into my family history, and found out that we are actually

208
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.180
Scott Moehring: bicycle barons in the U.S, so to speak.

209
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.489
Jerry Michalski: No way, from Dayton, or from where?

210
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.209
Scott Moehring: From Shelby, Ohio.

211
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.170
Jerry Michalski: Ohio? Had to be Ohio.

212
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.520
Scott Moehring: It had to be Ohio.

213
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.470
Jerry Michalski: Don't know why. Why Ohio?

214
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:04.009
Scott Moehring: My… I used to work in the retail industry in Ohio, and it was a 10-hour drive to

215
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.360
Scott Moehring: Well, I think it was 80% of the country.

216
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.120
Scott Moehring: Population-wise?

217
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.219
Jerry Michalski: Erie… the Erie Canal, I think, helped with… yeah.

218
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:24.989
Scott Moehring: But it's like, it's nowhere, but it's… you can get to everywhere. So that's kind of what it was. So as a result, I found out that… that I ended up doing a design for a bicycle museum.

219
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.589
Scott Moehring: And I made a timeline that was 27 feet long. It's still hanging up in the police…

220
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:36.570
Scott Moehring: department. They had a little space where they could hang this, and they said, we're gonna take this space and turn it into

221
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:43.199
Scott Moehring: This used to be… the building used to be the bicycle factory. So, this was a place that in the early…

222
00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.919
Scott Moehring: 1900s was running 3 shifts.

223
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.960
Scott Moehring: When the country was going through the… The crash.

224
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.720
Scott Moehring: the Great Depression.

225
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:58.689
Scott Moehring: They were running 24 hours a day and building housing for people, and so they could move to Shelby, Ohio.

226
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:06.900
Scott Moehring: So, what I found out as making this, timeline, was that there was a period… I'm looking at my notes here…

227
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:12.999
Scott Moehring: between 1876 and 1903 in the U.S, so that's 27 years.

228
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:17.840
Scott Moehring: Where we made these 8 things. These 8 things appeared.

229
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.500
Scott Moehring: The telephone?

230
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.550
Scott Moehring: The internal combustion engine, The light bulb.

231
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:32.970
Scott Moehring: the power plant, The electrical power plant, the modern bicycle, the radio, the airplane, and the automobile.

232
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.510
Scott Moehring: And I was astonished that in this

233
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.590
Scott Moehring: short time period, all of these things appeared.

234
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.770
Scott Moehring: And what life was like before that, and what life… Has been, like, since that.

235
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:55.159
Scott Moehring: And, you know, we're always talking about change now, which is, you know, related to progress, right?

236
00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.630
Scott Moehring: And I thought.

237
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:04.460
Scott Moehring: The world would be unrecognizable if all of the… when all those things show up all of a sudden.

238
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:13.890
Scott Moehring: And what I realized is that for the most thing, most part, most of the things we have now that we would call progress are just an iteration on

239
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.419
Scott Moehring: What we have already.

240
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:23.090
Scott Moehring: Yes, there are some new things, but most of them, I think, are just iterations, and…

241
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:29.380
Scott Moehring: I have a picture of me riding a 110-year-old bicycle that I did a couple of months ago.

242
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.759
Scott Moehring: And it looks…

243
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:39.810
Scott Moehring: Looks like a bicycle. Like, yes, you can say, oh, it's different, but you really have to look at the details to say it's different. You're gonna say, oh, it's a bicycle.

244
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.450
Scott Moehring: My phone is a phone. Yeah, I can carry it in my hand.

245
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.839
Scott Moehring: But… Cell phone.

246
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:57.969
Scott Moehring: And I'm wondering if, on the subject of progress stalling, If satisficing comes into it.

247
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:05.130
Scott Moehring: Satisficing is that term where you're reaching… you reach an adequate result rather than an ideal one.

248
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.540
Scott Moehring: And then you just… Accept it and move on.

249
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:14.250
Scott Moehring: And I would… Make the argument that That's what we do.

250
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:22.989
Scott Moehring: for things that, you know, ideal is a… I mean, I'm sorry, adequate is kind of a broad thing, and…

251
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:31.639
Scott Moehring: Maybe some of these things that are broken are also… In some perspectives, adequate.

252
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:36.089
Scott Moehring: We're adequate enough That they just kind of keep…

253
00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:42.960
Scott Moehring: Keep going, because… yeah, we can iterate on them, but… But…

254
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:56.450
Scott Moehring: they're… they're fine. They somehow satisfy us. Good enough, yes. Exactly. Which I find to be a healthy mindset for many things, but it also can be a stagnating one.

255
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.250
Scott Moehring: for other things. So, that's my thought.

256
00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:02.719
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Scott.

257
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:09.890
Jerry Michalski: You've provoked a whole bunch of interesting things happening in the chat as well, which is great. Doug, please.

258
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:20.800
Doug Breitbart: Yeah, I… I… Scott, I love that. And… and… I wonder whether…

259
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.399
Doug Breitbart: One man's progress is another man's destruction.

260
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:35.860
Doug Breitbart: That, it's actually in the failure breakdown…

261
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.320
Doug Breitbart: No longer fit for purpose or use.

262
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:45.449
Doug Breitbart: Of major societal and cultural features and institutions.

263
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.099
Doug Breitbart: That progress lies.

264
00:30:50.030 --> 00:31:02.079
Doug Breitbart: That in their inability to meet needs, in their inability to Actually serve and support Manifest experiential Progress.

265
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:07.780
Doug Breitbart: In quality of people's lives, in emotional experience of their living them.

266
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:15.490
Doug Breitbart: that, out of… out of those breakdowns, and out of that.

267
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:24.069
Doug Breitbart: System collapse, sprouts what's needed and what's new that constitutes progress.

268
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.840
Doug Breitbart: And I'm complete with that.

269
00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.140
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, son.

270
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.530
Jerry Michalski: I think that the whole,

271
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.880
Jerry Michalski: Whole question about who's… who sets…

272
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:51.780
Jerry Michalski: Who delivers our visions of the future is super interesting, and sci-fi, we've had, in the chat, we've had a lot of conversation about sci-fi authors and sci-fi visions.

273
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:57.370
Jerry Michalski: Victoria mentioned Ted Chang, who has really interesting opinions on this. There are many others.

274
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.580
Jerry Michalski: Mike mentioned David Brinn.

275
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:08.479
Jerry Michalski: That would make it its own good topic, which would be, like, a sharing of who our favorite science fiction

276
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:19.719
Jerry Michalski: vision writers are. Unfortunately, too many science fiction writers are writing dystopian futures, and not enough are writing more utopian futures. I wish I'd read more Ursula Le Guin.

277
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:29.989
Jerry Michalski: Because she was very much describing worlds in which gender happens differently, and other kinds of things happen, and she was really trying to explore, I think, more positive futures, so…

278
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.349
Jerry Michalski: That would be an interesting…

279
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:36.279
Mike Nelson: That trend is changing. That trend is changing.

280
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.130
Jerry Michalski: The dystopian is shifting?

281
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:43.829
Mike Nelson: Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, just the last 10 years. I mean, for a while there, that's all you got.

282
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:50.050
Mike Nelson: But, no, that is… there's a concerted effort, and, there's clearly a market.

283
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:57.300
Mike Nelson: for envisioning better worlds, and we could… I mean, I know David Bryn very well, I'm sure you do. There's also the UC San…

284
00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.600
Mike Nelson: Ghost Center that,

285
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:01.450
Jerry Michalski: Vertiv?

286
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:11.850
Mike Nelson: Yep. Well, no, no, he was involved in it, but there's a Clarion Writer's Workshop, and some of the people there are also…

287
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.680
Mike Nelson: Helping influence this.

288
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:22.249
Mike Nelson: I'd love to have a topic on this, because I think how literature impacts our vision of the future is very important.

289
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.620
Jerry Michalski: That sounds great. Good idea, thank you.

290
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:26.840
Jerry Michalski: Dave?

291
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:51.479
David Witzel: Well, and I was just tossing in the, I stuck in a few links to some of the Tyler Cohen stuff from a year or so ago, where they're talking about kind of a science of progress, and so they're, you know, it seems to be… it bubbled up a little while back, but I was struck… I've been struck a couple of times by, like, how recent some of these ideas are that we have humanity as an objective of progress.

292
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:58.679
David Witzel: And the notion that we can contribute to progress, and so I kind of accidentally stumbled across this field of miliorism, which

293
00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:09.990
David Witzel: you know, I guess I've probably read a little bit of James and stuff, but it's from, like, the late 1800s, where the notion… Western philosophy was grappling with whether humanity was supposed to help improve the world or something.

294
00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:21.559
David Witzel: You know? And it's like, 150 years, give or take, kind of, you know? And so before we had this notion of progress, I think it was like, hey, life's good, we're living a life, you know? Look, life!

295
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:36.790
David Witzel: And that would be a very different, you know, kind of mandate than, you know, like a striving towards something undetermined. So, I just thought it was funny that, you know, I feel like we very much internalized the notion that we were supposed to create progress.

296
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.710
David Witzel: But, you know, what if you didn't?

297
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:54.400
Jerry Michalski: Which is parallel to the sort of growth mandate that capitalism puts us under, which is everything must grow and get bigger, and, you know, everybody aspires to be the next Facebook, or what have you, you know, or NVIDIA these days, I guess.

298
00:34:54.409 --> 00:35:11.669
David Witzel: Well, and that's part of what I think, you know, drives me nuts about, like, the Tyler Cohn stuff is because… and it is a very mechanical mindset, as opposed to what Pete's talking about, and often, you know, growth means let's make it more efficient, you know, so we're, you know, we're just kind of squeeze the last, you know, bit of blood out of that cow on the I-5, so…

299
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.920
Jerry Michalski: Oh, man.

300
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.720
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, were you jumping in?

301
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.080
Stacey Druss: No, I'm sorry, did I make noise?

302
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.089
Jerry Michalski: You lit up the microphone, so I was like, oh…

303
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.600
Jerry Michalski: Sorry. Let me… no worries, let me go to Alex.

304
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.079
Alex Kladitis: Thanks, David, that, that was, that was it, that was good.

305
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:39.009
Alex Kladitis: just to go back to what Scott got me thinking, and then Doug as well, that…

306
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:49.690
Alex Kladitis: If you take as an example, and I'm gonna talk about this, I have… I'm really not intellectually invested in this or understanding, but I will say, for example, in economics.

307
00:35:49.690 --> 00:36:00.299
Alex Kladitis: The way central banks run the world's economic system, or their own central bank, and then by default, other ones, is they aim for 2% growth.

308
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:12.110
Alex Kladitis: Now, that is quite interesting, because why not zero growth? Because then things don't get more expensive. Why not 10%? They're kind of trying to maximize and minimize all sorts of competing

309
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:18.490
Alex Kladitis: theories, even assuming that the theories work, but that's what the thing. So it just strikes me that

310
00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.060
Alex Kladitis: And Scott sort of got me thinking about that, says.

311
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.950
Alex Kladitis: There's a controlled… there's partly a mechanistic

312
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:35.179
Alex Kladitis: profit-driven, controlled iteration. So if you've got a million subscribers that pay for your service.

313
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.909
Alex Kladitis: And you find a new way of doing the same thing, which means you lose half a million of them.

314
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.619
Alex Kladitis: Will you actually put that into effect?

315
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:53.120
Alex Kladitis: And the theory goes that, well, if it's competition, then someone else will, or whatever. But I think we're getting big enough now where that isn't necessarily playing out anymore, it's sort of…

316
00:36:55.810 --> 00:37:00.389
Alex Kladitis: there's a lot more directive, and I think other people have mentioned that, there's a lot more directive

317
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.819
Alex Kladitis: Control over how we progress.

318
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:14.260
Alex Kladitis: than there was… there was ever before. Who was it that said that in China they do it one way, and here we do it by lawyers, or whatever, the West do it by lawyers? I think it was, Mike.

319
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.820
Mike Nelson: Yeah, that was… I was quoting this new book called Breakneck.

320
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:23.850
Alex Kladitis: Yeah, so, so I do think it's a feature now of the system that

321
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:32.219
Alex Kladitis: it's… I cannot say… blame anyone or point to anyone. I say this system has iterated to be a controlled growth system.

322
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:37.210
Alex Kladitis: Rather than a… Whoever, you know, We're suddenly… everybody's…

323
00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:43.299
Alex Kladitis: as much food as they want, as much whatever as they want. I don't think the system would allow that in today's

324
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.680
Alex Kladitis: Rules, societal, economic, and everything, rules.

325
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:51.800
Alex Kladitis: But I'm way beyond my expertise now, so that's my gut feel.

326
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.040
Jerry Michalski: Thank you for swimming out into the deeper waters.

327
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:11.880
Jerry Michalski: And it's interesting that we've spent very little, not zero, but very little time talking about social progress, and things like gay marriage, and the things that there's major backlash against right now.

328
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.850
Jerry Michalski: for me.

329
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:23.809
Jerry Michalski: you know, a better world among humans is definitely a kind of progress I would rather have than faster flights.

330
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:31.169
Jerry Michalski: For sure. Now, greener energy that doesn't destroy the planet, I'm on… I'm on that… I'm on board that train, too.

331
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.530
Jerry Michalski: To mix metaphors, maybe.

332
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.280
Jerry Michalski: But… but…

333
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:51.250
Jerry Michalski: How we can't manage to get rid of wars, how we manage to still otherize people and successfully pump the public into a frenzy about those other people, and then run the table on policies.

334
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:56.359
Jerry Michalski: that aren't friendly to humans, I… I don't… I don't think that's progress at all. I think we're moving

335
00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:03.290
Jerry Michalski: moving backwards pretty quickly right now on those things, and I would love to know what progress looks like there. Gil?

336
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.100
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, it just complicated things for me, Jerry, thank you.

337
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.880
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Oh, excellent. That's my job.

338
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.959
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, so there's several things here, but pro-

339
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:34.399
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So I agree with you about things like gay marriage, but other people don't. So is that progress or not? That's very subjective, subject to the culture and subcultures and so… and belief systems that you live in. So there's that level of things. There's not, you know, are we looking for universal definitions of progress, or progress as we and our cohort see it? That's sort of one.

340
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.770
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: On wars,

341
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:50.540
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, on the one hand, there hasn't been a major war in Europe for, what, 70 years, until recently, after, you know, in Europe with a history of hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of years.

342
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:51.530
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: of warfare.

343
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.790
Jerry Michalski: It's… if you look back on Europe's history with wars, it's just nasty.

344
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:56.670
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

345
00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:02.209
Jerry Michalski: There's the Hundred Years' War, the Thirty Years' War, the Six Year's War, and everybody's going after everybody

346
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.939
Jerry Michalski: So often, it's crazy.

347
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:12.800
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, that's my point. That was crazy, and then post-World War II, there was 70-some-odd years of no war in Europe, until Putin and his gang, you know, started to…

348
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.620
Victoria (Spain): Let's have a problem.

349
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.119
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: kick shit up, so there's, you know, so there's that.

350
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.040
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Huh?

351
00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:35.160
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Victoria's mic was making some noise, I just… Right. You know, so there's a question in that of what is the trajectory or timeframe that we're looking at, and, you know, and the historical cycles and the long trends. Yep. And, you know, we tend to pay attention to our own lifetimes here.

352
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:44.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It's particularly disturbing now, because my lifetime has been mostly, until recently, a history of what I would consider progress, social progress.

353
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.960
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But…

354
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.630
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, clearly backsliding now. So there's that whole dimension, but I wanted to respond to Alex about growth.

355
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.759
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Or to whoever about growth.

356
00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.030
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Because clearly, you know, we now live in a system that privileges growth.

357
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:11.950
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, if I'm a corporation, my profits grew, you know, revenues grew 5% last year, and somebody else's grew 5.2% last year, I'm in the shithouse. So there's that game.

358
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:23.539
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: On the other hand, degrowth denies the biological reality of every organism is designed to feed and reproduce and propagate, so there's a natural growth in living systems, but it's constrained.

359
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:34.289
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: By resources, competition, and so forth. It's not infinite. Living systems have a quality called satiation, which human capitalist economic systems seem not to.

360
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:43.659
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, a lion goes out to hunt and brings down a wildebeest and drags it back to the pride, and everybody eats, and what do they do next? They don't go out and get another one, they go to sleep.

361
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.130
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Because they've eaten enough, and we don't have enough here.

362
00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.940
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But, you know, so the notion of

363
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:06.550
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: David, was it you who said that progress is this relatively recent or specialized concept? Progress was not always a drive in human history.

364
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.929
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There was care.

365
00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:15.200
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And there was a growth of a certain kind within resource constraints, but progress as a goal.

366
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.010
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Maybe wasn't there.

367
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:35.040
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And so that comes in, you know, does that come in with capitalism? Does that come in with technology? Where… does that come in with certain religions? the notion of betterment in the context of care, you know, I'm gonna build a better house, take better care of my family.

368
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.829
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There's that. There's progress as accumulation of wealth and power, which maybe is a different thing.

369
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.289
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I don't know where else to go with that, but there's a whole territory to explore there.

370
00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:55.239
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And takes me back… takes me back to Victoria and my question at the top of the call, which is, what do we mean by this, anyway?

371
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:04.550
Jerry Michalski: Love that. And that conversation about what do we mean by this and why.

372
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:15.859
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: is, I think, a more illuminating and provocative question than trying to determine… put a score on whether there's been progress or not, because it reveals what we are each caring about.

373
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.530
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm complete.

374
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.029
Jerry Michalski: Thanks. So what do we care about?

375
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.300
Jerry Michalski: What does matter?

376
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:37.470
Scott Moehring: Well, I… I don't know why this pops into my head, but sometimes when I'm…

377
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:44.939
Scott Moehring: wanting to feel grateful, I realized that I… being naked in a jungle.

378
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.679
Scott Moehring: I would probably be worse off.

379
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:55.150
Scott Moehring: Just, maybe not for the next 15 minutes, but for the next year.

380
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:56.999
Scott Moehring: If I survived.

381
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:09.560
Scott Moehring: And… So… what is progress? Is it how many people are… not… Naked in a jungle?

382
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:15.300
Scott Moehring: I don't know if that… is an adequate definition, but I think it's the start.

383
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:22.699
Scott Moehring: Of a definition, perhaps, that… There are so many things that we have that are…

384
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.100
Scott Moehring: Go back 200 years, did not have.

385
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.459
Scott Moehring: Go back 500 years, did not have.

386
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:38.390
Scott Moehring: And… Hopefully, we find ourselves Not reversing that.

387
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:47.279
Scott Moehring: And finding that our… Offspring are worse off, and closer to the jungle.

388
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:53.270
Scott Moehring: That's an unformed thought, but I'm… offering.

389
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.080
Jerry Michalski: There's a… Gil, go ahead.

390
00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:02.879
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I just wanted to say what I put in the chat, Scott. What's wrong with Naked in the Jungle?

391
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.970
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Naked in the Jungle has worked very well for lots of humans for a very, very long time.

392
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:12.410
Scott Moehring: And none of us would be alive at this age. Probably.

393
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.480
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It's not clear. From the archival evidence, not clear.

394
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:23.960
Scott Moehring: It's unclear. I would say unclear is not a rousing… Argument for, let's all…

395
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:25.420
Scott Moehring: Go back to the jungle.

396
00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:37.010
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No, no, no, I'm not saying let's all go back to the jungle, I'm saying that the common meme of people naked in the jungle as an indication of a bygone age that was much more terrible than that is we don't know that.

397
00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:39.230
Scott Moehring: Okay.

398
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:47.830
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That's the, you know, that's the argument that Wengro and Grapeut weighed into early in Dawn of Everything about these two visions of human society.

399
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:53.360
Scott Moehring: And if we don't know that it's… and we don't… if we don't know that it's worse, we also don't know it was better.

400
00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.530
Scott Moehring: So, really, the don't know.

401
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.370
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

402
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:56.960
Scott Moehring: I think.

403
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:05.790
Mike Nelson: I think that archaeological data is becoming more and more clear, and the… percentage of…

404
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:14.349
Mike Nelson: Males of breeding age who died of violent means in almost every ancient society.

405
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.849
Mike Nelson: Wasn't, you know.

406
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:29.280
Mike Nelson: 40% greater. It was 400% greater, or 1,000% greater. I put a note in here on that. Clearly, when things are more disrupted, either because

407
00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:38.969
Mike Nelson: You now have hunter-gatherers at war with the agricultural societies, which was about 8,000 years ago. Then you had an explosion of violence.

408
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:43.819
Mike Nelson: But the data I've seen is pretty concrete.

409
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:52.189
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Graeber and Wengro argue that that those phenomena were highly localized and variable, dependent on the society and culture.

410
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.329
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Not on… not on the ear.

411
00:46:54.330 --> 00:47:02.009
Mike Nelson: I mean, the data shows that when there is disruption, whether climatic or changes in the organization of society.

412
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.099
Mike Nelson: Much more violence, but…

413
00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:14.549
Mike Nelson: There's no evidence for a golden age where everybody holds hands and gets along, and my tribe of 300 people don't interact with your tribe, and we all are just very happy.

414
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:30.569
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No, no, no, and that's not what they're saying. They're saying that you will find situations where in the same region, you'll find some tribes that are peaceful and some tribes that are warlike, and not interacting with each other. I mean, I don't know the details of this, but part of their argument is a much more variable tapestry of human history than what we tend to assume.

415
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:31.930
Mike Nelson: Oh, yeah.

416
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.749
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Not like it evolves in a unified way over time, but it's very noisy.

417
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:40.470
Mike Nelson: We are agree… we are agreeing vehemently. Yeah. You do the average.

418
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:41.040
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yep.

419
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:54.870
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I'm saying, let's not do the average, let's look at the variation, because their argument, I think, is that if there's that variation, then there's the possibility of different phenomena arising, more or less, and what are the circumstances for that, and how do you nurture that?

420
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.710
Mike Nelson: Well, again, for a green… for a green…

421
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:59.980
Jerry Michalski: Violently. I'm going to.

422
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.580
Mike Nelson: Our hope is not violent.

423
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:03.780
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, we'll stop.

424
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:09.279
Jerry Michalski: I'm gonna thank Alex for his patience and go back to, the normal order of things.

425
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:17.060
Alex Kladitis: Stacy, do you want to contribute to that? Because I'm just going to move it slightly off.

426
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:35.759
Stacey Druss: just one statement, and it's just to be provocative. I just want to point out that this idea about, like, life and living is sort of cultural in nature. There are some… I know it's weird, but I actually have met people that

427
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:43.050
Stacey Druss: When their loved ones pass, they don't even grieve the way we do, because

428
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:55.949
Stacey Druss: their idea of death is very different. So, I just want to point that out, because we all seem to think, like, you know, living in… at all costs, like, that is the be-all and end-all.

429
00:48:55.950 --> 00:49:04.690
Stacey Druss: But if you really believe that this is just one page in the book, and you're going on to the next page, the thinking shifts. I just wanted to…

430
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.410
Stacey Druss: Throw that out there.

431
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:10.720
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, thank you. It's all our frame of reference. Back to Alex.

432
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:12.510
Alex Kladitis: was good.

433
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.399
Alex Kladitis: That frame, what you just discussed, and it's a great discussion, right?

434
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.570
Alex Kladitis: Is historical progress, so we're comparing with times past.

435
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:28.489
Alex Kladitis: But we're in the now, and we're… one way of thinking, one aspect of this question is.

436
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.019
Alex Kladitis: Do I feel like there's progress?

437
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:37.019
Alex Kladitis: I'm in the moment, Therefore, my feeling of progress might not be as…

438
00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:42.309
Alex Kladitis: I might not feel as much progress. Maybe progress is happening.

439
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:48.609
Alex Kladitis: If we stand back, and… well, maybe in 20 years, when we look back, we'll say, oh, that happened, that happened, that's progress.

440
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:55.930
Alex Kladitis: But right now, we're living in it, and… We naturally don't feel Or, we demand more.

441
00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:07.239
Alex Kladitis: I want flying cars. You know, I want a flying car out there. Sorry, you know, I'd just love to have one for the hell of it. And I want suddenly to, I don't know.

442
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:14.010
Alex Kladitis: world's greatest battery to be invented, you know, I want this progress. I want cancer to be cured. Boom, just like that.

443
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.190
Alex Kladitis: But it takes time.

444
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.750
Alex Kladitis: So…

445
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:26.719
Alex Kladitis: Historical is one aspect, but what you feel is another aspect, and you're too close to the leading edge to feel it, perhaps.

446
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:32.610
Alex Kladitis: And if someone comes up and says, Alex, you're wrong, and I'm feeling it, that's fine. I'm okay with that.

447
00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.739
Jerry Michalski: Somebody should do that just to do it, I mean, really.

448
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:39.340
Jerry Michalski: Kidding?

449
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:52.929
Jerry Michalski: So… Do we want to change our notions of progress? Are we… Is… is progress overheated? Doug?

450
00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.399
Doug Breitbart: So, so, yeah.

451
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:07.370
Doug Breitbart: I, I would, offer… Progress as…

452
00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:14.150
Doug Breitbart: An evolutionary maturation of our species, such that…

453
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:19.470
Doug Breitbart: We managed to remember, reconnect with…

454
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:27.629
Doug Breitbart: The larger whole and the more transcendent idea of beyond my survival and self-interest.

455
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.270
Doug Breitbart: What's in service to the whole?

456
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:46.269
Doug Breitbart: And, that… that on a… on a vitality, in alignment with natural law, in alignment with biome, in alignment with what's in service to life, what's in service to survival.

457
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:55.949
Doug Breitbart: That it's all of us or none of us would be progress. And I… and I actually…

458
00:51:56.470 --> 00:52:07.130
Doug Breitbart: Just to sort of double down on that… Would… You know, suggests that…

459
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:19.510
Doug Breitbart: That is an emergent… it's been an emergent phenomena at different periods of… Transformation, transition, disruption.

460
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.689
Doug Breitbart: Those ideas percolate through.

461
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.849
Doug Breitbart: And they tend to be, you know, delivered by a persona.

462
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.909
Doug Breitbart: And they tend to generate global ripples and influences and effects.

463
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:40.490
Doug Breitbart: And I think part of…

464
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.059
Doug Breitbart: Part of what might be missing today from

465
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:55.049
Doug Breitbart: The next, sort of, guiding light and or pointer indicator toward transitioning out of the dystopic.

466
00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:59.070
Doug Breitbart: Chaos that we're in in the moment.

467
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:06.740
Doug Breitbart: Is that right now, that global persona is missing. Like, I don't know that we have a bunch of those.

468
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:11.060
Doug Breitbart: But they tend to come out of these periods.

469
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:16.260
Doug Breitbart: Like, they emerge… they percolate out of them.

470
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.060
Jerry Michalski: Modern axial age kind of thing?

471
00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:27.910
Doug Breitbart: Yeah, and the messengers, or the channelers, or the bearers of light, you know.

472
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:36.000
Doug Breitbart: I think will… will surface and appear. Right now, we're in this period of… The absence of.

473
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.549
Doug Breitbart: And for lack thereof, everybody's, like, in chaos.

474
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:48.210
Jerry Michalski: Victoria, if you want to jump in, you're saying something along these lines in the chat.

475
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.869
Jerry Michalski: I'm curious what your thoughts are.

476
00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.760
Jerry Michalski: Victoria, did you hear me?

477
00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.529
Stacey Druss: Yeah, but you… she's muted. Do you have to unmute her since.

478
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:02.330
Victoria (Spain): No, no, sure.

479
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:03.120
Jerry Michalski: He's unmuting.

480
00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:09.380
Victoria (Spain): I said that progress for the sake of progress seems like

481
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:16.470
Victoria (Spain): A vain goal, or a stupid goal, because you need to know what you are progressing toward.

482
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:25.910
Victoria (Spain): and then Jerry asks, if, progress was our new god, and I said, no, progress is the god.

483
00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:32.410
Victoria (Spain): that made the illustration the Enlightenment, sorry, the Enlightenment. Now.

484
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:49.650
Victoria (Spain): We are a very varied people. We are not homogeneous. You Americans think one way, and I say you Americans because I see you from Europe, but you think different from your neighbor, and…

485
00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:50.810
Victoria (Spain): So…

486
00:54:51.260 --> 00:55:01.930
Victoria (Spain): Some are thinking that the Church of the Flying Spaghetti saucer, and the others are thinking about economic,

487
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:07.840
Victoria (Spain): Sharks, and the others are thinking, going to meditate and feel…

488
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:18.870
Victoria (Spain): So, it's to their priorities. We are not, Borgs. I don't know if you remember Star Trek and the Borgs?

489
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:20.220
Victoria (Spain): Though.

490
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:20.570
Jerry Michalski: Right.

491
00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:29.679
Victoria (Spain): were the buddies who were… They integrated everything, but they were, like, a single organism.

492
00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.409
Victoria (Spain): They didn't have individualism.

493
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.269
Victoria (Spain): We… we do.

494
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:46.310
Victoria (Spain): We need to find a balance between the individual, the individual, and the society, but we have individualism. We are not works.

495
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:47.910
Jerry Michalski: And, and…

496
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:58.750
Jerry Michalski: Is there a… is there a religion that does that? I mean, FSM, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a… it's also known as Pastafarianism, which I… a term I adore.

497
00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:14.799
Jerry Michalski: is posed as a fun religion, as a tongue-in-cheek religion, and I own the domain fubarism.com, which is exactly inspired by the Flying Spaghetti Monster and things like that, but it's meant to be a serious question if you got to invent your own…

498
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:19.100
Victoria (Spain): belong to the Judaism, is it youth?

499
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.200
Victoria (Spain): And this is the church of the Judahism. Take it easy.

500
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.440
Jerry Michalski: Awesome!

501
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:29.390
Victoria (Spain): There are…

502
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.620
Jerry Michalski: Who knew that the… who knew that the big Lebowski was gonna make it into this call?

503
00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:38.830
Jerry Michalski: Pete, please.

504
00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.000
Pete Kaminski: I think I wanted to pick up, kind of.

505
00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:48.660
Pete Kaminski: where Doug, Doug B. was.

506
00:56:49.430 --> 00:57:04.890
Pete Kaminski: And it made me think… I like what you said, Doug. And I wanted to play contrarian for a sec, not because I think it's a good thing, but because we live with this contrarian thing.

507
00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:17.500
Pete Kaminski: We have, demonstrably billionaires whose idea… one billionaire's idea of progress is, life sentience will become multi-planetary.

508
00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:26.269
Pete Kaminski: And that's pretty much the only thing he cares about, really. I mean, he cares about lots of chaos and fun and hooliganism.

509
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:40.239
Pete Kaminski: But he's been steady on his goal of, life must become, multi-planetary, you know, down the torpedoes, I don't care who dies, or who hates it, or what, we're just gonna do it.

510
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:57.109
Pete Kaminski: We have another billionaire, running the country, running the country, whose… his progress for him has been dominance. I can make whatever decision I want, I can say whatever I want, I can…

511
00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:12.290
Pete Kaminski: deploy the U.S. military however I want. I can invade whatever I want, in-country or out of country. I can kill whoever I want. I can destroy whatever building I want, and I can build whatever building I want.

512
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.919
Pete Kaminski: That's progress for him. So… and…

513
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:31.669
Pete Kaminski: to get to the point where those people could make those kinds of decisions, society-wide decisions. We had, you know, a few hundred, you know, several centuries of moving up the ladder of…

514
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:40.329
Pete Kaminski: the golden rule. The people with the most gold get to make the rules. And, you know, so we've gotten to the point where

515
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:51.310
Pete Kaminski: we have progress. A few people make, dramatically Life-altering decisions for…

516
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:57.889
Pete Kaminski: Billions of people on the rest of the planet. And they make the… they make them more or less unilaterally.

517
00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.900
Pete Kaminski: So…

518
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:11.420
Pete Kaminski: so at least for some people, you know, we can talk about, well, I wish we could raise the tide for everybody. For a few people.

519
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.050
Pete Kaminski: they're thinking.

520
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:32.880
Pete Kaminski: what I care about is that a few people, especially me, are going to be the highest we can get. I can make the most decisions affecting the most number of people, and have the most resources available to me, and I don't care what happens to the rest of the distribution of the population. I really don't. So, just a reflection that,

521
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:35.600
Pete Kaminski: the… progress.

522
00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:39.529
Pete Kaminski: Progress is different for different people, and some of us, it's very different.

523
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.920
Pete Kaminski: In a way that harms everybody else.

524
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.210
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Pete.

525
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:54.309
Jerry Michalski: Mike, do you want to tell us about How Progress Ends, the book you just pasted the long link into the chat about?

526
00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:58.460
Mike Nelson: I've only read the book reviews, so… and it was a biased book review.

527
00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.690
Mike Nelson: So… but I… it's very related.

528
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.880
Mike Nelson: There's… there have been a couple of very good, sort of.

529
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:16.770
Mike Nelson: libertarian texts on the barriers to progress, not just the one about China, but also a couple other… Reason magazine has done a series of articles on

530
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:35.930
Mike Nelson: on why we're getting in our way, and why we have to have social progress, as well as technology breakthrough. I mean, what I've heard from this talk today is reaffirming my statement at the top, which is, I think everybody's agreeing that technology continues to progress.

531
01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:45.299
Mike Nelson: different in different places, and that a lot of the focus has been on social progress, and why… and the lack of social progress is…

532
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.410
Mike Nelson: Has… has held back.

533
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:51.759
Mike Nelson: So many people from enjoying the benefits.

534
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.539
Mike Nelson: I don't know if anybody saw the Washington… the Wall Street Journal today.

535
01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:02.289
Mike Nelson: But I was almost moved to tears. It was an article about corruption in South Africa.

536
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.689
Mike Nelson: South Africa has now become the most economically unequal country in the world.

537
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:12.689
Mike Nelson: Which is really quite a feat.

538
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.080
Mike Nelson: And basically, the ruling party

539
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:25.090
Mike Nelson: In the name of spreading the wealth and, you know, destroying the apartheid system has just… Given.

540
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.199
Mike Nelson: Most of the…

541
01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:37.750
Mike Nelson: economic activity of the country to a handful of very well-connected people in the… in the, African National Committee. I mean, it's just the ANC…

542
01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:41.099
Mike Nelson: It's just a corruption machine. And again.

543
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:49.179
Mike Nelson: they have progress in South Africa. They certainly have a lot more information technology and great apps, and…

544
01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.289
Mike Nelson: People are getting educated better.

545
01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:55.499
Mike Nelson: But it isn't showing up in the daily lives of most of the people.

546
01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:03.659
Mike Nelson: So, you know, maybe… maybe in the future we can… we can actually ask that question, and I, I, I'm particularly…

547
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.860
Mike Nelson: Concerned about corruption just eating our society.

548
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.560
Mike Nelson: Not just in the US, but in South Africa. It did in Russia long ago.

549
01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:22.129
Mike Nelson: And I don't know, I mean, to be positive, maybe we, you know, have a discussion about the few places where people have done something to

550
01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.740
Mike Nelson: To push back against corruption, or to build the guardrails.

551
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:33.209
Mike Nelson: But even in… even in the Nordic countries, which have always been very transparent and very good about fighting corruption, there is…

552
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.660
Mike Nelson: There's a modern bandit class that seems to be showing up, and…

553
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.180
Mike Nelson: Using the power structure to get more.

554
01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.170
Jerry Michalski: Right.

555
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:47.280
Alex Kladitis: Can I come in on this. Sorry, Jerry.

556
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.179
Jerry Michalski: Go ahead, Alex.

557
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.150
Alex Kladitis: Mike?

558
01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:56.950
Alex Kladitis: I am shocked to hear you say those words that you just said. They're great. I believe them, but I considered myself to be a…

559
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.130
Alex Kladitis: A conspiracy theorist to have these thoughts, honestly.

560
01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:14.020
Alex Kladitis: I'm shocked that you just said that. I literally have spent my life, or not my life, the last few years, saying to people, wake up, you know, there's something wrong with the way that the system is.

561
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.389
Alex Kladitis: And, you know, I'll call it, what is it?

562
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.219
Alex Kladitis: crony capitalism, but, you know, it's…

563
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.440
Alex Kladitis: I'm, I'm… I'm impressed. I'm really pleased that we said that.

564
01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:31.049
Mike Nelson: Yeah, well, we should, as I say, I think… how to defeat crony capitalism.

565
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:37.770
Mike Nelson: Would be a very interesting topic, because it would get us focused on what's going on, and get us…

566
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:41.079
Mike Nelson: Rather than saying, how do we reinvent capitalism?

567
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:44.220
Mike Nelson: Just focus on that one piece of the puzzle.

568
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.169
Jerry Michalski: I love that question. I think it's a… it's a great question.

569
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:53.670
Jerry Michalski: One of the reasons that I've had

570
01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:04.639
Jerry Michalski: a couple of side calls and a couple of topics around, governance, like what works in governance, for example, and then I have a thing I call the next two stacks. What are our new stacks?

571
01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:13.240
Jerry Michalski: is that centralization tends to corrupt, absolute centralization corrupts absolutely, to paraphrase Lord Acton.

572
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.369
Jerry Michalski: And, you know.

573
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:31.230
Jerry Michalski: in Russia, a peasant from the Republic of Georgia can take over the whole thing because they've designed a pyramid that has complete authority at the top without any checks, and then you have, like, a whole bunch of bad stuff happens, and everywhere we see

574
01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:37.219
Jerry Michalski: those kinds of structures arise, they tend to not play out very well, so I was hunting for

575
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:55.319
Jerry Michalski: and am still very much hunting for. What is the new stack of things that communities, large and small, can choose from and adopt voluntarily that would do things like increase prosperity, raise the sustainability of their biosphere or their watershed.

576
01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.640
Jerry Michalski: Help them conquer corruption.

577
01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:03.389
Jerry Michalski: And defeat… expose and defeat corruption. Make them… one of the problems with…

578
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:19.590
Jerry Michalski: pacifist societies living next to warring societies is that the warring societies tend to have better weapons and less morality, so they come tromping in. And this is the story of human history writ large, unfortunately.

579
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:30.800
Jerry Michalski: is that all too often, the people who see something nice happening next door just go in and take it. And so how do you make it very… how do you turn communities into porcupines.

580
01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:32.950
Mike Nelson: Or pufferfish.

581
01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:43.190
Jerry Michalski: So that, when someone tries to ingest them, they have to barf them back out. I'm really interested in Taiwan. How might Taiwan turn itself into a pufferfish?

582
01:05:43.310 --> 01:06:00.780
Jerry Michalski: Ukraine kind of is, but it's not really working. I mean, it's pretty clear to me that most Ukrainians would absolutely hate and undermine a regime under Putin to their dying breath, that it is such a poison, such a poisoned relationship that they would, you know, stand up.

583
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.979
Jerry Michalski: But, but how do we do the opposite? How do we create…

584
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:12.170
Jerry Michalski: Or how do we compose or make available a bunch of things that actually make for a better life?

585
01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:18.680
Jerry Michalski: And bake into them, some set of things, and I don't know if that means

586
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:29.699
Jerry Michalski: some kind of verifiable identity on the blockchain? I don't… I don't know, that's beyond my pay grade. I don't know if that means other kinds of things, but I'm extremely interested in that.

587
01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.249
Jerry Michalski: I think that we're… and the lack

588
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:44.970
Jerry Michalski: of a stack like that means that when the Arab Spring happens, and all of North Africa basically overturns their governments a couple decades later, they are no better off.

589
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:49.190
Jerry Michalski: Because nobody had a thing they could reach for that would stop

590
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:54.210
Jerry Michalski: The corruption from taking over, the powers that be from before, from coming back and just…

591
01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:58.780
Jerry Michalski: Adopting new clothing, but still running the country, all those kinds of things.

592
01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:12.079
Jerry Michalski: So, it's a little depressing to look at how human history has failed to progress in those ways, but I think it's very possible, but it needs to be done in some much more distributed, decentralized way.

593
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:20.710
Jerry Michalski: I look to the, you know, Fetiverse and IndieWeb and decentralization on the net as maybe examples, but I'm not sure.

594
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:28.109
Jerry Michalski: The crypto world doesn't feel to me like the answer. So for me, a part of the betterverse involves

595
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:34.420
Jerry Michalski: evolving these kinds of stacks and having serious conversations to make these things better and better over time. Sorry, Mike, go ahead.

596
01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:39.719
Mike Nelson: Because of this discussion, I just discovered that there is a museum of political corruption.

597
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.120
Jerry Michalski: Oh, nice!

598
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:48.629
Mike Nelson: Yeah, I don't know if it's real, I don't know if it's a physical place, it could just be a virtual museum.

599
01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.980
Mike Nelson: But they do have halls of shame and halls of honor.

600
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:55.739
Mike Nelson: Pretty cool. I put the link.

601
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.370
Alex Kladitis: Good night.

602
01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.870
Alex Kladitis: That's great, thank you.

603
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:58.370
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

604
01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:10.650
Alex Kladitis: without any actual proof, because… but my uncle has passed now, like, 50 years ago, when we used to talk politics and corruption, because I was in Africa, so it was all corruption, whatever.

605
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:15.959
Alex Kladitis: I lived there. He used to say, but Alex, you have to grow your thinking.

606
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:23.850
Alex Kladitis: He said, the difference between Africa and we used to live in Greece, and here is corruption happens here.

607
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.039
Alex Kladitis: It's just more sophisticated.

608
01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:37.590
Alex Kladitis: And as you go, say, to the British, they're even more sophisticated. You don't see it, but corruption is endemic across all societies. So I wonder… I wonder how people feel about that.

609
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:42.250
Alex Kladitis: Because that's my feeling, is there's a lot of corruption everywhere, it's just…

610
01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.850
Alex Kladitis: Transparent here, not so transparent, you know, a bit obtuse or opaque over there.

611
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.100
Mike Nelson: It all depends on how much shame there is.

612
01:08:52.290 --> 01:09:00.490
Mike Nelson: And I know one reason Nigeria has been a… Epicenter for online scamming.

613
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.750
Mike Nelson: is because… When it first started happening.

614
01:09:06.029 --> 01:09:12.169
Mike Nelson: there was a celebration of these scams. The scammers were almost national heroes.

615
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:19.839
Mike Nelson: one of the first things that happened in this regard wasn't on the internet, because the internet wasn't really there.

616
01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:24.900
Mike Nelson: there were some guys sending faxes to the World Bank.

617
01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:39.879
Mike Nelson: And they were… they were… they were offering these special deals. Oh my god, I just need a million dollars, and then we can unlock all this money, and we can give you the finder's fee, and it was exactly the same thing that's going on 25, 30 years later.

618
01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:55.530
Mike Nelson: But there was a sense of, you know, the Robin Hood. You know, let's take money from these rich countries and, you know, we'll spend it here. And that's why there's 100,000 people in Nigeria in the online scamming business.

619
01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:06.330
Jerry Michalski: I think it's a little bit like, the narco trafficantes in Mexico, because there are narco ridas, or something like that. There's basically a genre of Norteno music.

620
01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:07.859
Mike Nelson: that celebrates.

621
01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:14.189
Jerry Michalski: that celebrates the nautical cartels, because they are an economic success of some sort.

622
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:27.060
Mike Nelson: And it's bringing money back into the community. I mean, it's… there are indirect benefits to the average person in the street if they're not caught in the middle of the crossfire.

623
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:38.399
Alex Kladitis: Can I ask this question? Because we shouldn't discuss this, because it's a different topic, but on the issue of Nigeria being scam capital for that reason, which is good.

624
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:42.920
Alex Kladitis: In the 90s, I remember Canada was also

625
01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:59.479
Alex Kladitis: a big source of scamming schemes to do with shares, owning shares and whatever. And I don't know, that's… but the mechanics must be totally different there. And why Canada? And since then, they actually tried to lock it, you know, get rid of it or whatever.

626
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:07.750
Alex Kladitis: So I don't know if there's any… anything more in Canada versus anywhere else in the world, but it just fascinates me that it hopped across.

627
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:12.649
Mike Nelson: Well, one… one reason, and I'm sorry, Doug, it's your turn, but one…

628
01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:13.740
Alex Kladitis: Sorry, Doug.

629
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:23.400
Mike Nelson: I think the reason that Canada and the Caribbean are hotbeds of phone scams is that they share the same country code with us.

630
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.740
Mike Nelson: So they're also, you know, country code 1.

631
01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.109
Mike Nelson: And so these little countries, little islands, look like a local call.

632
01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.130
Mike Nelson: from another.

633
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:37.140
Jerry Michalski: So we have the North American Numbering Plan to blame for this?

634
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.650
Mike Nelson: Yeah, it's… I'm not picking this up. This is… this is…

635
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:41.680
Jerry Michalski: Lord!

636
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.030
Mike Nelson: Yeah.

637
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:45.509
Jerry Michalski: You sound like Dave Berry. I am not making this up.

638
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:49.080
Mike Nelson: Love it.

639
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.110
Jerry Michalski: of Dave Berry.

640
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:54.119
Doug Breitbart: I am not making that… this is real, he…

641
01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.239
Jerry Michalski: Made a lot of headway on humor from real life.

642
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:58.920
Jerry Michalski: Doug, please.

643
01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:07.449
Doug Breitbart: I, what came up for me, a colleague of mine

644
01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:11.130
Doug Breitbart: had a lot of contact with the Kogis.

645
01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:28.550
Doug Breitbart: Which is an indigenous tribe, and they… they have gone on these, missions to Europe and around the world to raise money to buy their land back, basically, their ecosystem and regional, envi… you know, territory.

646
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:35.309
Doug Breitbart: And so they go on these trips to raise money, basically. And…

647
01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:41.390
Doug Breitbart: Over the course of the trips, and there are these mamins, there were this sort of,

648
01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.510
Doug Breitbart: the… the leaders of the tribe, and direct connect to source, and…

649
01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:54.910
Doug Breitbart: And they sort of channel, you know, what's needed and what's next in decision-making and all the rest.

650
01:12:55.470 --> 01:13:03.510
Doug Breitbart: And… over the course of several trips, you know, one of the Mamins was sort of… Corrupted.

651
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:12.950
Doug Breitbart: you know, exposed to Western conveniences, and Western this, and Western that, and, you know, they had to sort of pull him out.

652
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.399
Doug Breitbart: of the travel core.

653
01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:25.480
Doug Breitbart: To, you know, re… reintegrate him back into the tribal… You know… Gestal.

654
01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:34.270
Doug Breitbart: And… You know, so the… so the question, the question for me is.

655
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:37.130
Doug Breitbart: You know, what is that pull?

656
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.640
Doug Breitbart: about.

657
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:41.930
Doug Breitbart: You know, what is… what is the…

658
01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:49.880
Doug Breitbart: Literal corruption on a soul basis, on a values basis, on an identity basis.

659
01:13:50.680 --> 01:14:00.439
Doug Breitbart: Because… Corrupting is the verb. And what's being corrupted when people become corrupt?

660
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:06.960
Doug Breitbart: You know, what in their makeup, what in their identity, what in their awareness or consciousness?

661
01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:17.019
Doug Breitbart: Is either turned off, or is neutralized, or is negated, or is abandoned, or stunted, or missing.

662
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:24.089
Doug Breitbart: In terms of an individual's makeup, that renders them corruptible.

663
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:32.379
Doug Breitbart: And the question… and sort of the flip side question, which is, what strengthens, you know.

664
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:40.739
Doug Breitbart: cultural and societal Alignment on our values, and… And, and relational level.

665
01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:49.780
Doug Breitbart: That renders a culture, a society, somewhat more Teflon or immune.

666
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:54.320
Doug Breitbart: To influences that corrupt the fabric that binds.

667
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.439
Doug Breitbart: So, with that, I'm complete.

668
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:01.890
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Doug. It feels like you've just described half of Western literature.

669
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:07.789
Jerry Michalski: I'm like, oh man, so many good plots came out of what you just said.

670
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:13.840
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Jerry, could I jump in? Because we've got to leave for a doctor's appointment.

671
01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.379
Jerry Michalski: Please, the man in the hat.

672
01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:19.389
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, just a quick comment before Ken shows up with a poem.

673
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.030
Jerry Michalski: Well, it is.

674
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:27.320
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't know either, but it's a ritual thing. What Doug said reminds me of Doris Lessing's notion of the substance of we feeling.

675
01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:38.769
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That she talked about in the Remarkable Shacosta trilogy, and that that appears or breaks in society, is that, you know, that notion of a kind of mutual care, responsibility, and so forth as an anti-corruption.

676
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:53.670
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: component. And last, on the matter of corruption, I'm a biomimicist. I tend to look at the 3.8 billion years of open source R&D that Earth's living systems have generated, that's available for us, for free.

677
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:55.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: To draw from, if we choose to.

678
01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:03.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But if I look at those systems, I see that parasitism and predation are part of the game.

679
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:11.799
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And so what we've been calling corruption is our… is the name that we are giving to that phenomenon.

680
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:16.309
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And maybe that phenomenon is natural and inevitable.

681
01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:24.939
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And then what? Or maybe it's something that is natural and inevitable, like in living systems, is constrained and limited, or self-limiting.

682
01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.879
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Parasites can't destroy the host, because they die if they do.

683
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.429
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Part of the problem with our modern systems is that we don't have the

684
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:44.580
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't even know the word for it. We don't have the kind of coupling between systems, the appropriate feedback loops, and so forth, that provide the damping.

685
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:50.030
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And constraint of these inevitable phenomena, so they go haywire.

686
01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:58.830
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And that's where we are now, and I… Doug, Doug, I like your phrase, but I can't say I'm complete, because I'm not, but there you are. I'm done speaking, at least.

687
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.430
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Thank you, everybody. We have to leave. I'll catch you on the recording.

688
01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.850
Jerry Michalski: Thanks. Thanks, Gil.

689
01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:12.170
Jerry Michalski: And we only have a few minutes left in this particular call.

690
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:22.009
Jerry Michalski: Anybody want to summarize, plot a path forward, critique, Whatever you'd like.

691
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:30.000
Scott Moehring: For what it's worth, I… Go toe-to-toe with… Ill from time to time.

692
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:35.140
Scott Moehring: But I do definitely agree with him on this, and it's something I've been trying to…

693
01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:40.339
Scott Moehring: Wrestle with, is the idea of Seeing the system.

694
01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:42.459
Scott Moehring: Accepting the system.

695
01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:48.899
Scott Moehring: And then… Deciding what you want to do, but understanding that

696
01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.879
Scott Moehring: As he said, some of these things just… they exist.

697
01:17:53.170 --> 01:18:01.640
Scott Moehring: And our hubris that we could somehow create a system of 8 billion where it doesn't… exist.

698
01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:09.650
Scott Moehring: seems… like a… Perhaps the wrong direction.

699
01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:14.310
Scott Moehring: How do we… How do we dance with it?

700
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.620
Scott Moehring: Instead of damming it.

701
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:20.439
Scott Moehring: You know, how do you surf on the wave instead of…

702
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.100
Scott Moehring: Trying to have a still pond.

703
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:33.039
Scott Moehring: I don't know, that's all just spontaneous out of my brain there, so I'm not sure where that's going, but I think that there's something important.

704
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:38.010
Scott Moehring: about staying… We need to have a world where these things don't exist.

705
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.679
Scott Moehring: Versus… We need to live in a world where these things do exist.

706
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:50.290
Stacey Druss: as long as we're doing that dance to go to something else Gil said in the chat.

707
01:18:50.300 --> 01:19:06.330
Stacey Druss: he made the distinction between corruption and scamming, which I think is an important one, because corruption is something done by the powerful. We're scamming, there is a lack of power, which is why they have to scam in the first place. I mean, I…

708
01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:11.210
Stacey Druss: I think that there's a difference there. And if you're gonna look at the whole dance.

709
01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:14.099
Stacey Druss: I think you have to look at that piece, too.

710
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:14.950
Jerry Michalski: Offensive.

711
01:19:15.190 --> 01:19:20.199
Mike Nelson: The scam, though, leads to power and money that then goes back into corruption, so there's…

712
01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:26.060
Jerry Michalski: It's a little infinite loop, and then you do… and then you do jail time, lose your money, and you have to go back to scamming, I mean…

713
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.979
Stacey Druss: Whatever it is, it's fluid, and so…

714
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:33.540
Mike Nelson: The point is exactly right, but there's no way to separate the two.

715
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:42.549
Scott Moehring: What I'm hearing from Stacy, though… Stacy, clarification. Are you seeing a… are you referencing a sense of scale in that? To me, corruption feels…

716
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:51.520
Scott Moehring: larger and more coordinated, and scamming feels more peer-to-peer, but I don't know, that's how I'm taking it. I'm curious how you…

717
01:19:51.900 --> 01:20:05.810
Stacey Druss: I'm just saying… I'm not even… I'm not even answering the question, I'm just raising the question, and just bringing it out, just saying, let's look at the whole thing, you know.

718
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:08.929
Stacey Druss: I'm just asking the question.

719
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:18.229
Mike Nelson: The route is often the same, the fact that people have no shame. And I mentioned in the Nigerian case, the scamming happened because…

720
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:21.919
Mike Nelson: well… I think they…

721
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:30.039
Mike Nelson: understood the idea of shame, and there were a lot of religious people who thought that that was stealing. There was also a sense of, hey.

722
01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:34.740
Mike Nelson: We're taking money that was stolen from us, so… So, there.

723
01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.970
Stacey Druss: Right, and I'm all…

724
01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:48.270
Mike Nelson: And I do worry that we have… I mean, that would be a great question, too. You know, have we reached the end of shame? And with certain members of the political class here in Washington, starting with Mike Johnson and J.D. Vance.

725
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:51.000
Mike Nelson: They clearly have no shame.

726
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:57.589
Jerry Michalski: Actually, shamelessness is a positive strategy of the far right. It's a very intentional thing.

727
01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:09.199
Jerry Michalski: It's a really intentional thing, and it's working like crazy. And this is a tangent, but it worries me no end, because nonviolent social action

728
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:11.639
Jerry Michalski: Absolutely depends on shame.

729
01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:15.689
Jerry Michalski: It absolutely depends on shame.

730
01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:16.140
Mike Nelson: Harding.

731
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:27.660
Jerry Michalski: on, you're counting on people seeing how crappy those people's behavior is, and being ashamed, and changing their minds, and voting differently, or overthrowing the government, or whatever. But if we're entering the post-shame era.

732
01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:32.439
Jerry Michalski: I'm afraid a lot of our assumptions about what might work and how to do things

733
01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:36.780
Jerry Michalski: Might just break, might not work at all, and that's got me pretty scared.

734
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:41.709
Mike Nelson: I marched in the No Kings March here in Washington, and a lot of the posters assumed

735
01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:45.260
Mike Nelson: that shame was still a powerful force. But you're right.

736
01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:45.890
Jerry Michalski: I know.

737
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:51.320
Mike Nelson: If George Santos Can have… be given leniency.

738
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:56.039
Mike Nelson: And all these Republicans are like, oh yeah, right, you're right.

739
01:21:56.350 --> 01:22:03.299
Mike Nelson: That means shame is gone. I mean, this guy, I mean, he stole from tens of thousands of good, loyal Republicans.

740
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:05.110
Stacey Druss: Sure, just ask me.

741
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:06.860
Jerry Michalski: Trump has over and over again.

742
01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:18.629
Stacey Druss: Just one thing really quickly. Even when you say something like, shame is gone, I just want to remind you, yes, shame is gone in that way, but now, shame about their sexuality, they have that.

743
01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:38.349
Stacey Druss: So when we make these blanket statements, I just want us to remember that, yes, if we're looking at one thing, it's true, but we can look at something else, and it's not true. And that's something that we humans seem to do a lot. We make this blanket statement, and we don't recognize that if we flip it around.

744
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:41.069
Stacey Druss: It's absolutely a wrong statement.

745
01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.539
Jerry Michalski: Love that. Thank you, Stacey.

746
01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:45.980
Jerry Michalski: Pete?

747
01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:57.740
Pete Kaminski: It, it's, it's terrible that we've lost a sense of shame in politics. It's really striking and horrifying.

748
01:22:57.910 --> 01:23:05.420
Pete Kaminski: And I… on corruption, I… I… that's a really interesting topic, and I want to make sure that we

749
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:15.410
Pete Kaminski: don't… don't end up aiming for zero corruption. I think, in… in any complicated system, there's gonna be some

750
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:25.870
Pete Kaminski: some graft and corruption, and if it's done right, it actually kind of lubricates the whole… the whole system and keeps it going. It's when…

751
01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:44.799
Pete Kaminski: it's when the corrupted folks don't have a sense of shame, or proportion, or balance, or something like that, that it… it grows and turns into something malevolent. It's kind of like… it reminds me of living in a world with a lot of

752
01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.229
Pete Kaminski: viruses and bacterias and stuff like that, you know, if everything is kind of, like.

753
01:23:49.800 --> 01:24:03.910
Pete Kaminski: homeostatic, then, you know, it's like, yeah, your body kind of deals with it. It's actually good to have a little bit of low-level irritation going on. But when it gets out of control, you know, when some kind of balance goes off, then it's bad.

754
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:13.479
Pete Kaminski: The reason I raised my hand was because, Jerry, when you said it, you know, is there anything we want to wrap up with, I… the thing my… one of my

755
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:32.289
Pete Kaminski: top carry takeaways from this was, Mike said something like, how to defeat crony capitalism would be a great topic, and I want to second that. That's a… that seems like it kind of, like, narrows down and fits a lot of stuff. So, I want to raise my hand for that.

756
01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:36.979
Jerry Michalski: Love that. And, next Thursday is not the first of the month yet.

757
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:39.999
Jerry Michalski: So, I think we've found our topic for the 30th.

758
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:43.830
Jerry Michalski: Thank you for that.

759
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.889
Doug Breitbart: Can I offer a slight tweak?

760
01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:46.900
Doug Breitbart: Instead of…

761
01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.870
Jerry Michalski: That or a benediction.

762
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:53.260
Doug Breitbart: Instead of defeating crony capitalism, how about rendering it obsolete?

763
01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:58.370
Mike Nelson: Even better. Even better.

764
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.150
Jerry Michalski: Sounds great.

765
01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:05.670
Jerry Michalski: I'm changing the wording in my notes.

766
01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.480
Jerry Michalski: This has been really fun. Thank you for,

767
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.369
Jerry Michalski: Thank you for joining, and as usual. Victoria, thank you for joining us.

768
01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:18.719
Jerry Michalski: You're very happy you're here.

769
01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:20.940
Victoria (Spain): for having me.

770
01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:26.270
Jerry Michalski: We are… we are really glad to have you here, and… Alright, alright.

771
01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:32.369
Jerry Michalski: The duking it out in the… everywhere in the chat and in the conversation worked wonderfully, so thank you.

772
01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.849
Jerry Michalski: Anyone else with a closing thought?

773
01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:47.180
Jerry Michalski: We don't have Ken for a while, with a poem, sadly. So, Victoria, Ken Homer has been a long-standing member of this group, and he's sort of decided to step out of things for a bit. He's also moving.

774
01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:50.939
Jerry Michalski: to Spain, I think. I think he and his wife are moving to Valencia.

775
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:55.169
Jerry Michalski: And he had this… he is,

776
01:25:55.380 --> 01:26:14.610
Jerry Michalski: wanted to be an actor when he was young, so he has a great presence and speaking voice, and also loves poetry, so he would find poems and read them to us at the end of a lot of OGM calls. So if you watch the recordings, you'll see poems at the end. If you go through my notes in the brain, you'll find, for every OGM call, a link up to the poem that Ken read to us.

777
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:21.969
Jerry Michalski: And it's been a really lovely custom. If anybody else feels like picking up that, that,

778
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:25.329
Jerry Michalski: I was gonna say duty, it's not a duty, it's a…
