00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is the OGM weekly call for Thursday, October 23rd, 2025.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Our topic today is, has progress stopped?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I was just starting down that path when I realized I hadn't turned on the recording, so now it's on.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But there's some obvious questions like, hey, we're not flying any faster or traveling any faster than we did.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In the 1950s.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
what's up with that? There are other cultural questions. I was pointing to Ted Joya, who has…

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
really interesting essays about popular culture and how the infinite scroll seems to be eating thoughtful culture, etc., etc., and I think we'll

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we'll find other angles to put into the conversation.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
As we go here. Uh, so let me go with Alex.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Oh, sorry, I had to speak up on this, because I think.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're going to go down the intellectual route. And I do believe that one of the factors is… that with the way we have progressed our civilization has progressed.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There are so many big… interests that actually are beginning to work against.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
progress. The exception is computing, IT. For some reason, that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But has bucked the trend. But I would argue that if anything came out.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
tomorrow, but… the best battery there ever was that would solve all the problems.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the oil industry and the governments, and everybody will say it was too much impact to the economy of the world, therefore.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
will buy it out, and that would be the end of it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So there's a… there's now an overweight… kind of hegemonic.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
interests in the world economy. But I actually, in certain ways, suppressing progress, if the progress is going to be massive.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
disruptive, etc. And I know I've discussed this with many other people, and they'll say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, Alex, or whatever.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But I actually think that's part of the cycle.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I just wanted to put that in before we go to the intellectual route, which is also a very good.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
route to go.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Um, I think that, that, you know, vested interests in the economics of progress are somewhat intellectual. I mean, they're not emotional in the sense of it's not, you know, coming from some very different place.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's just a piece of the analysis, I think. So I paraphrased what you just said badly, probably, in the chat.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
vested interests will kill most progress, that people who have, uh, you know, whose golden goose will be killed,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We'll make sure that any novel thing that endangers their business will not thrive? Is that what you mean?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Yes, that's what I mean, yes. And they're big enough to do it now.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And we've…

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
they have enough influence.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And we've seen plenty of things like this. I'll point to a favorite old example, which is the great American streetcar Conspiracy.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
In which, uh, American…

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
General Motors, uh,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Firestone, Philips 66, and Mac Truck wanted to sell bus, uh,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
more buses in the U.S., so they bought up most of the light rail lines which existed and were thriving.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And then slowly turned down service, and then shut down the lines.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And because they realized that once you've pulled up the rails and burned the cars, nobody's gonna go install a brand new

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Light rail line, and as a result, we have car culture, not, uh,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
public transit culture, and we struggle.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you know, Portland has a… what I consider an extremely wimpy,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
light rail system that kind of makes it around, and, you know, it's not good. And then you go to Berlin, and you drop in, or you go to any major international city.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And you drop in, and you're like, OMG.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Uh, they have layers and layers of public transit, which is running all the time really snappy, and is, uh, you know,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
very serviceable, so…

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Firestone.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I thought the tire companies were involved, too. Yeah. Oh, you did say that, okay.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Yeah, and they got found for antitrust, but it was too late because blah blah blah. I mean, you know, the government found against them.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the whole thing. Kill, please.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
You're… you were muted, but now you're not. Good.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Sorry, does that… yeah, I had to hit some toggles.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Um, so I think there's a question behind your question, Jerry, of what is progress.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Um,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Yes. Which, uh, which Victoria asked in the chat.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yeah, which I… but no, and I had asked in the chat above, and Pete thought I was asking the wrong question, but several of us are interested in going in that direction, number one. Number two,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Um, the example of transportation in European cities is… calls into question whether the lack of progress in the United States is about the lack of progress of humanity.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Uh, progress may be highly localized.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And, um, it seems to me there's progress in lots of areas. Do I have screen share?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I'll just show you something?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Yes, it's set by default for everybody to be able to screen share.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Okay, let me just see if I can pop this open real quickly here.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Because if we look at, you know, if we look at things like energy transition, renewable energy, progress of the price and performance of renewable energy over the past

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
20, 30 years has been striking.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And we are now… we now have more renewable energy being generated on the planet than coal-generated energy.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So there's, you know, there's progress in some dimensions there. Let's see, desktop here…

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
For example, you know, stuff like that. So that would argue that there is progress, although, you know, climate degradation is proceeding apace, environmental degradation proceeding apace.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Um, personal in our lives, I'm looking at medical progress, and I have a wife who would not be alive.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Um, without certain kind of cancer research that's happened. I'm in remission from a disease that, when she was first diagnosed, we were told we'd kill her in 2 years.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And she's now 11 years in and in remission.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So, I gotta, I gotta count that as progress.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Yep. Um…

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, so, so back to my… so my starting question is, when you say, you know, is progress ended, it's like, what do you mean by progress?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Which is a great question to ask.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I will say that…

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
how our energy is generated happens behind the curtain.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And so we don't necessarily see it, and the electricity that shows up at the socket is the same electricity that showed up at the socket at 1950, so there's no

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
perceived difference to our daily lives, the way there would be if supersonic airplane travel had taken over. We'd be like, oh my gosh,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You can get to London in 2 hours instead of, you know, 9.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Although I now have an induction range.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So I have a better cooking experience and less toxic pollution in my house and less fire risk, with the same electricity. And the electricity comes from my roof.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
with a backup battery that switches over in microseconds if there's a power outage.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So, yeah, it's the same electrons.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But the overall experience is certainly better for me.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And the electrons are having a much better time of it, so…

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I hope so. I hope so.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
That's good. Um…

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Mike? Yeah, please.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, point you're being, Jerry, that… so there's several layers of interpretation happening in this conversation.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I'd like to open them up and have them be visible.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I… I… that sounds great, and if you would like to step back in and propose…

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
progress framework, some way we can kind of look at and separate out these things, that would be cool. I mean, I'm into that exploration, that sounds great.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I'm gonna hold off on that and ask you what you… because you raised the question, what do you mean by progress? Give us a…

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:46.000
you know, a framing or contextual definition of how that lives in you. Because there's… you clearly have a strong, you know, you have interpretations and strong feelings about this, but let us inside your brain case.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
That's funny. Um, I…

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Don't think I'm a proponent for the notion that progress has died. I am definitely not in that camp.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Okay.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I am, uh, I am provoking the conversation here intentionally.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
With the notion that we all kind of broaden out what we mean by it,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Uh, what examples of it stand out for us, and so forth.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And I think the place I'll go to is the superficial end of progress, which is

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the dramatic ways in which people's lives have been affected. So, our grandparents likely lived through electrification.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Um, and their parents probably lived through a hygiene revolution.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And so on and so forth. Things that were major. You know, when the outhouse goes away and you have running water and it's clean, and you get less sick,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And all that. Those are really pretty large things.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And, um, there may not be…

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Large changes like that left? I doubt that, sincerely. It may be that AI takes us through the next large change like that, and we're living through it this very instant.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
That's an interesting proposition.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
But yeah, so Gil writes in the chat, so progress as transformation of daily life. I think that's one…

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
superficial way of looking at it, but when people ask, where is my flying car, that's kind of what they're asking. It's like, hey, I expected by now that I could

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You know, or maybe I could hit a button on my phone like I do for Uber, and a hexacopter would land in my backyard and take me anywhere I want in the city by now.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Well, heck, where is it?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And maybe that's not it. And maybe…

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Don't get me started on the word civilization, because if we go back to the dawn of everything and a bunch of other angles here,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you know, technological progress and economic progress tends to be

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
At the cost of a whole bunch of other things that we may value more, that progress might actually be

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
a relentment on.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:45.000
pushing technology on us that gets us addicted, that this, that, that, that, the other, that progress might in fact be something entirely different. So I'm open to anybody who wants to wave that flag.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
in this conversation, because I probably feel stronger about that.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
than I do about where's my flying car? Because I don't particularly want

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
urban, uh, urban airscapes.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
littered with, uh, drones and air taxis and all this other kind of stuff, because

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
A fender bender at your corner,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
is something that the rest of the city can ignore.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
a couple of, you know, quadcopters crashing into each other and dropping into a neighborhood is not something that's easy to ignore.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, like that. Mr. Nelson.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Uh, I'm gonna be… provocative and obnoxious, and say.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Excellent.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
rewrite this question. I mean, we have already been diverted 10 minutes by talking about what is progress.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And that's… I mean, it's just not useful. I mean, all of us have different definitions. I've got at least 5.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Um, I would… actually propose we narrow to something that we might actually be able to talk about for an hour and make some… progress on, and that is… Are there more barriers?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
to technological development. I mean, when I hear the word progress, I can say, okay, well.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:11.000
That's… are we having more… scientific and research discoveries.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Uh, and then the second part is, are we applying those discoveries in cool, exciting new technologies?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And then there's… are there economic barriers that actually prevent us from using those cool technologies?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:35.000
like the Super Battery example. And then there's a whole other line of progress, which is… Are we building our societies in better ways? And I would say that.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Progress towards a better American democracy. is not gonna happen for the next 3 years.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And we can have a whole discussion about. societal progress and evolution of… of governance systems.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But I just… I mean, your question is so broad, wide open, we're gonna all talk past each other. Each of us will… make our contribution, and then the next person will say something different, and because.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We're all coming from a different place. of what progress we think is most important.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I mean, we could go straight to the… output, right? And say.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the improvement in the quality of daily life. that we have seen for the last 200 years.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:32.000
is plateauing or ceasing. I mean, that would be a very provocative thing, and… I would argue against that if we took a global perspective.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I think here in the U.S, the quality of life is not doing very well, partly because we're… amusing ourselves to death, and we're all… Dealing with so many conflicting demands for our time, and…

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And what I… and what, um… Dilbert used to call Confusopoly.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000
These companies are… throwing so many options at us, and they're… they're constantly trying to confuse.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
what the product is that we're paying for, and how much we pay. I mean, we just don't have time to sort through the crap.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And they won't answer the phone when we call them.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So that's a whole other thing about customer service, and there's… I think… I think despite the new AI tools, these call centers are… doing a better job of diverting you away from your end goal than getting you there. That's a very niche.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
example of progress. But, um, there's just… too many things that we could talk about.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
with your question, so I would… I would propose a counter question, which is.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Are there more barriers. too technological.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000
improvement. than in the past. Um, and I would throw two… two things out. If you haven't seen them.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Corey Doctorow's new book, In Shitification. is directly on this question about why can't we have good things.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Why aren't technological breakthroughs leading to customer service breakthroughs and quality of life improvements?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And then the other one is… is… a deeper and actually more important book called Breakneck.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the subtitle says it all. how China is engineering our future.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And the one-line summary that every book review has mentioned is.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000
China is a… society run by engineers.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:43.000
who build things. America has evolved into a… lawyerly culture.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that obstructs things. And it's… it's becoming more true every day.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Long screed, I hope that's a helpful suggestion. Um, see where it goes.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Um…

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Good. So, I… I…

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And thanks for raising a very important issue. I just… I think… We need to…

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I empathize with your feeling that the topic was too broad. I think our MO tends to be…

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Um, I throw a fish on the table, and then we sort of take different stabs and swings at it, and see where it goes, and we end up in something that we generally like and sort of settle into.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And I'm unclear that everybody else on the call wants to talk about technological progress.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Um, which is kind of, kind of why I framed it really broadly.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And by the way, if any of you have followed the Peter Thiel and the Antichrist thread, which I followed last week,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Uh, to my sort of chagrin dismay and great interest.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It's crazy. He's… I think he's saying, and I believe Peter Thiel believes that anybody who throws a barrier in front of

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
you know, AGI and superintelligence from these new devices and other kinds of progress.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is the Antichrist, and should be dealt with accordingly, which is a little…

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
frightening. I will… I will post a link to that in my… in my brain. There's a bunch of great articles about that.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Uh, yeah, Countiesopoly now has a Wikipedia page, which is nice.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I'm in Victoria.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I was thinking something similar to Mike. But in another completely different dimension.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Because progress comes from what we have imagined as a future.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And the French writer Jules Bernet. the outside of 80 days traveling the world in Balloon, this kind of… He… for so… so, or… He gave us a framework to look forward.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
So, who is imagining our futures? who are now playing this role?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:04.000
of imagining possible outcomes for the future. Because everything I see nowadays, it's… AIi, AI?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
out space colonies? immortality?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And maybe the metaverse or something like that? And all the narratives are very dark, like Black Mirror.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So, the people imagining our futures. are painting them really black.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And maybe it's not only because the governments, the… laws in the Americas, laws in Europe.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Because we also have very restrictive laws. Maybe it's also because we ourselves are… Fearing what we have done.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
That was my reflection.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Thank you, thank you. Um, you're so right, so many of the visions that were being given are bleak.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And, uh, or, or whacked, like Zuckerberg's Metaverse.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
flavors. It's interesting, you just reminded me that we had a call in 2021.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
called Our Desirements for a Better Verse. I'll put a link to it in the chat.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
where, uh, I think it came out of someone in this group talking about desirements. I think it was at Scott?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
It was somebody who sort of coined desirements, which seemed like a lovely phrase.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And, um, we tried to talk about this notion of what… how would we imagine something better? So I actually bought the domain TheBetterverse.com.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I think? What is it?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
There we go. Uh…

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
TheBetaverse.org, which I don't think I've put much on, but I will put

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
it into, uh, into the chat.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And that was a lovely conversation, because we were trying to say,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
What is a better vision for our future? And I'm sad that Hank Kuna is not on this call. He's based in Amsterdam.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
He is currently with his wife in Thailand, having a very nice time going around the country.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And some time off. But Hank has spent most of his career

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
helping, uh, ordinary citizens develop, and children, and sort of mixed generations and so forth.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
helping them all develop visions of the future and articulate them and share them with each other, which I think is a…

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
an interesting notion, and its own little ball of complexity.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
But, uh, thank you.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Um, thanks. Thanks, Ray. It's an interesting, provocative question. Um, Mike, I…

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I hear you're…

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
uh… suggestion.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Um, and I actually don't find Jerry's…

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Um, Jerry's provocation.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000
to be disruptive, or distributive, or something like that. For me, the point of it is actually to have a messy discussion about…

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.000
what is progress? Who wants what? You know, how would I define it? How would you define it? How would we define it?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Um… so… so let me talk about what I…

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
think about progress a little bit. Um, I would say that… that…

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
humanity, uh, humans, have

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
kind of ebbed and flowed with progress over the past 10,000, 20,000 years.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Um, uh, it's nice that I never have to worry about being fed, unless I

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
lose my income and… and then…

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
you know, aren't supported by my weird society that doesn't really want to help people, who…

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
are, uh, less fortunate, or something than the rest of us.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Um, and, you know, that's not true 5,000 years ago, it might have been something really, really difficult to do, making sure that I got enough calories and enough protein and enough water every day.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Um, but on the other hand, um, I live in a society where we're all very isolated from each other, um,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
we have these very small communities, tight-knit communities. The nuclear family thing is…

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
is dumb. Um, you know, I should be living in a…

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:30.000
in a… you know, in a place where I'm surrounded by 100 people I really love, and get along well with, and then that group of us should be surrounded by a hundred communities, each about the same size.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Um, uh, all kind of living in harmony, et cetera, et cetera, right? Um, so…

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
you know, depending on… I… so I'm a little bit…

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I'm a little bit surprised that we're talking about economic progress or technological progress, or things like that.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Um, uh, or societal progress. You know, I wouldn't judge that a million-person city is a great advance over

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Um, a thousand-person village from a thousand years ago, you know? I mean, there's some awesome things about it.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
you know, museums, or…

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
um… whatever. Uh, culture stuff.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Um, but there's a bunch of bad stuff, too, and…

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And… and uh… on the flip side, um… I… another thing I'm surprised about is that we…

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I think we narrowed down on human progress very quickly. For me, what I care about is things like equity and opportunity, uh, agency for all living beings, not just humans. Um, and minimizing pain and suffering, especially

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Pain and suffering inflicted on one to another. So, we live in a world where we have these things called concentrated animal feeding operations.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Where I am aghast that humans can even live on the planet with themselves, with

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
subjugation and torture of other, you know, living beings.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
For their pleasure and benefit, you know, and it's like…

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
What the heck are we doing? And this is something that, you know, is a modern

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:27.000
progress from 100 years ago or 200 years ago, or 1,000 years ago. And I… I can't even imagine, like, I'm… I'm embarrassed every time I think about it, you know?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Oh my god, we think we're having progress over the past couple hundred years, and this is where we have ended up.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
And that's kind of one, you know, little thing. Um, you know, we have…

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000
a kind of progress and a kind of regression, um, in the way that we govern ourselves. Um, you know, the…

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
It comes and goes, but right now, I think we're doing a really bad job of

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
of…

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
selecting, um, a leadership

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:06.000
organization for the United States. And, you know, is that progress where we are with the current administration? I don't think so.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Um… so…

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Um, I guess in general, it's interesting. I love the question, you know.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Uh, is… has progress stopped? Um, uh, I… and… and kind of in answer, I think there's progress and regression in lots of different ways. Um, and… and I think…

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
I wish people… I wish humans paid more attention to non-humans, um…

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
And progress for them, as well.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Thanks.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Thank you very much.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Hey Scott, our topic today is…

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
has progress stopped?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And uh…

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
We're going around on that in different kinds of ways.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Are we going around, or are we raising hands?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
We've been raising hands, and there's a gap in the hand raise just now, which is why I said hi to you.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
I don't want to jump in.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Um, and uh… so we've been, uh…

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
putting a whole bunch of things, and part of it is, like, we're trying to adjust the lens and figure out, like, how big is the aperture of what we want to talk about, and what are we going to focus on, and so forth.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Yep.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Uh, and there's been a…

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I have a perspective on it, which is why I jumped in. I was hoping this would be the subject.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Uh, that sounds great, and I would love… we would love to hear your perspective.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Excellent. So, a couple years ago. I did a deep dive into my family history.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And found out that we are actually. bicycle barons in the U.S, so to speak.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Huh, no way, from Dayton, or from where?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Ohio. Had to be Ohio.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Don't know why. Why Ohio?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
From Shelby, Ohio. Um, it had to be Ohio. Um… Uh, my… I used to work in the retail industry in Ohio, and.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
It was a 10-hour drive to. Well, I think it was 80% of the country.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Yeah, and also the Erie Canal, I think, helped with… yeah.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Population-wise. Yeah.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Yeah.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
But it's like, it's nowhere, but it's… you can get to everywhere. So that's kind of what it was.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Cool.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Um, so as a result, I found out that I ended up doing a design for a bicycle museum.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And I made a timeline that was 27 feet long. It's still hanging up in the police.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
department. They had a little space where they could hang this, and they said, we're gonna take this space and turn it into.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
This used to be… the building used to be the bicycle factory.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
So, this was a place that in the early… 1900s was running 3 shifts.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
When the country was going through the… The crash, um, the Great Depression.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
They were running 24 hours a day and building housing for people, and so they could move to Shelby, Ohio.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So, what I found out is making this, um, timeline.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
was that there was a period. I'm looking at my notes here.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
between 1876 and 1903 in the US, so that's 27 years.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Where we made these 8 things, these 8 things appeared.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
the telephone? The internal combustion engine.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
The light bulb, the power plant. the electrical power plant. The modern bicycle.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
the radio, the airplane. And the automobile.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000
And I was astonished that in this. short time period, all of these things appeared.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And what life was like before that, and what life… has been, like, since that.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000
And, you know, we're always talking about change now, which is a, you know, related to progress, right?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And I thought… The world would be unrecognizable if all of the… But all those things that show up all of a sudden.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And what I realized is that, for the most thing.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Most part… most of the things we have now that we would call progress are just an iteration on.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:28.000
what we have. Already. This, there are some new things, but most of them, I think, are just iterations, and… I have a picture of me riding a 110-year-old bicycle that I did.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:41.000
a couple months ago. And it looks… Looks like a bicycle. Like, yes, you can say, oh, it's different, but you really have to look at the details to say it's different. You're gonna say, oh, it's a bicycle.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
My phone is a phone. Yeah, I can carry it in my hand.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:55.000
But… cell phone. Um, and… I'm wondering if, on the subject of progress, stalling.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
If satisficing comes into it. satisficing is that term where.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
you're reaching… you reach an adequate result rather than an ideal one.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And then you just accept it and move on.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
And I would make the argument that. That's what we do.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:32.000
For things that, you know, ideal is a… Or, I mean, I'm sorry, adequate is kind of a broad thing, and… Maybe some of these things that are… broken are also… In some perspectives, adequate.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:47.000
were adequate enough. that they just kind of keep… keep going, because… Yeah, we can iterate on them, but… they're… they're fine. They somehow satisfy. Good enough, yes.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Mm-hmm.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Exactly. Um… Which I find to be a healthy mindset.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
For many things, but it also can be a stagnating one.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
for other things. So, that's my thought.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Thank you, Scott. Uh, you've provoked a whole bunch of interesting things happening in the chat as well.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Uh, which is great. Doug, please.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yeah, I… Scott, I love that. And… and… Um, I wonder whether… Um.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:41.000
one man's progress is another man's destruction. That, um, it's actually in the… failure… break down… Um, no longer fit for purpose or use.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:50.000
of major societal and cultural features and institutions. that progress lies.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
that in their inability to meet needs and their inability to.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:03.000
actually serve and support. Manifest experiential progress.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
in quality of people's lives, in emotional experience of their living them.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Um, that, uh… out of… out of those breakdowns and out of that.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
system collapse. sprouts what's needed and what's new.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:31.000
that constitutes progress.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Thanks, John.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
And I'm complete with that.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I think that the whole, um…

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
whole question about who's… who sets…

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Who delivers our visions of the future is super interesting in sci-fi, we've had… in the chat, we've had a lot of conversation about sci-fi authors and sci-fi visions.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Victoria mentioned Ted Chang, who has really interesting opinions on this.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
There are many others. Mike mentioned David Brin.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
that would make it its own good topic, which would be, like, a sharing of who our favorite science fiction

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
vision writers are. Unfortunately, too many science fiction writers are writing dystopian futures.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
And not enough for writing more utopian futures. I wish I'd read more Ursula Le Guin.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Uh, because he was very much describing worlds in which gender happens differently, and other kinds of things happen, and she was really trying to explore, I think, more positive futures, so…

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
That would be an interesting…

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
path to follow.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
the dystopian is shifting?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000
That trend is changing. That trend is changing, and uh… Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean, just the last 10 years, that… I mean, for a while there, that's all you got.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
But, uh, no, that is… there's a concerted effort, and um… there's clearly a market.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
for envisioning better worlds, and we could… I mean, I know David Bryn very well, I'm sure you do.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Yeah.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Uh, there's also the UC San. Center that, uh.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Werner Vinji?

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Yep.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Um, has done some… Yep. Well, no, no, um, he was involved in it, but there's a clarion writers workshop.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And, um, some of the people there. are also helping influence this.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Um, cool. LaMarsha…

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
I'd love to have a topic on this, because I think how literature impacts our vision of the future is very important.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
That sounds great. Good idea, thank you.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Uh, Dave?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:37.000
what, I would just tossing in the, um… I stuck in a few links to some of the Tyler Cohen stuff from a year or so ago, where they're talking about kind of a science of progress, and so they're, you know,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:51.000
There seems to be… it bubbled up a little while back, but uh… I was struck… I've been struck a couple of times by, like, how recent some of these ideas are that we have a humanity has an objective of progress.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000
And the notion that we can contribute to progress, and so I kind of accidentally stumbled across this field of miliorism, which

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:09.000
You know, I guess I've probably read a little bit of James and stuff, but it's from, like, the late 1800s, where the notion… Western philosophy was grappling with whether humanity was supposed to help improve the world or something.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
You know? And it's like, 550 years, give or take, kind of, you know? And so before we had this notion of progress,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
I think it was, like, hey, life's good, we're living a life, you know? Look, life!

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.000
And that would be a very different, you know, kind of mandate than, you know, like a striving towards something undetermined, so…

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I just thought it was funny that, you know, I feel like we very much internalized the notion that we were supposed to create progress.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
But, you know, what if you didn't?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Which is parallel to the sort of growth mandate that capitalism puts us under, which is everything must grow and get bigger,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
And, you know, Megacor… everybody aspires to be the next Facebook, or…

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
or what have you, you know, or NVIDIA these days, I guess.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Well, and that's part of what I think, you know, drives me nuts about, like, the Tyler Cohn stuff is because… and it is a very mechanical in mindset, as opposed to what Pete's talking about,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
And often, you know, growth means let's make it more efficient.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.000
You know, so we're just kind of squeezed the last, you know, bit of blood out of that cow on the high-five, so…

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Oh, man.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Um, Stacy, were you jumping in?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
You lit up the microphone, so I was like, oh!

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
No, I'm sorry, did I make noise?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
But let me… no worries, let me go to Alex.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Thanks, David. That was good. just to go back to what, uh.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Scott got me thinking, and then Doug as well.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:50.000
But if you take as an example. And I'm gonna talk about this. I have… I'm really not intellectually invested in this or understanding, but… I will say, for example, in economics.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:57.000
the way central banks run the world's economic system, or their own central bank, and then by default.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
other ones, is they aim for 2% growth. Now, that is quite interesting, because.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Why not zero growth? Because then things don't get more expensive. Why not 10%? There's the kind of trying to maximize and minimize all sorts of.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
competing theories, even assuming that the theories work, but that's what the thing.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
So, it just strikes me that… And Scott sort of got me thinking about this, says.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
there's a controlled… there's partly a mechanistic. profit-driven, controlled.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
iteration. So if you've got a million. subscribers that pay for your service.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
And you find a new way of doing the same thing, which means you lose half a million of them.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.000
will you actually put that into effect? And the theory goes that, well, if it's competition, then someone else will, or whatever.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I think we're getting big enough now, where that isn't necessarily that.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
playing out anymore, it's sort of…

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
there's a lot more directive, and I think other people have mentioned that, there's a lot more directive.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:14.000
control over how we progress. than there was… there was ever before. Who was there that said that in China they do it one way, and here we do it by lawyers, or whatever? The West do it by lawyers?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Yep.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Yeah, that was… that was… I was quoting this new book called Breakneck.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
I think it was, um, Mike. Yeah.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Yeah, so… so I do think it's a feature now of the system.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
But it's… I can't blame anyone or point to anyone. I say.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
this system has iterated to be a controlled growth system.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Rather than, uh, whoever, you know. suddenly everybody's… as much food as they want, as much whatever as they want. I don't think the system would allow that.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:54.000
In today's rural societal, economic, and everything rules. But I'm way beyond my expertise now, so… that's my gut feel.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Thank you for swimming out into the deeper waters.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And it's interesting that we've spent very little, not zero, but very little time talking about social progress.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And, uh, things like gay marriage, and the things that there's major backlash against right now.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
for me, you know,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
a better… a better world among humans is definitely a kind of progress I would rather have.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
than faster flights.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000
For sure. Now, greener energy that doesn't destroy the planet, I'm on… I'm on board that train, too.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
to mix metaphors, maybe. Uh, but… but…

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000
how we can't manage to get rid of wars, how we manage to still otherize people and successfully

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
pump the public into a frenzy.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
about those other people, and then run the table on policies.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
that aren't friendly to humans, I… I don't… I don't think that's progress at all. I think we're moving…

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
moving backwards pretty quickly right now on those things, and I would love to know…

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
what progress looks like there. Gil.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Well, it just complicated things for me, Jerry, thank you.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Oh, excellent. That's my job.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Yeah, um, well, so there's several things here, but pro- uh…

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Yep.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
So, I agree with you about things like gay marriage, but other people don't. So is that progress or not that's very subjective, subject to the culture and subcultures and so… and belief systems that you live in. So there's that level of things. There's not, you know…

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Um, are we looking for universal definitions of progress, or progress as we and our cohort see it? That's sort of one.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Um…

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Um, on wars, um…

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Well, on the one hand, there hasn't been a major war in Europe for…

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
what, 70 years, until recently.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
After, you know, with… in Europe, with a history of hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of years.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
of warfare.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
It's… if you look back on Europe's history with wars, it's just nasty.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
There's the Hundred Years' War, the Thirty Years' War, the Six Years' War, the… and everybody's going after everybody

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
So often, it's crazy.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Well, that's my point, and so that was crazy, and then post-World War II, there was 70-some-odd years of no war in Europe.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Until Putin and his gang, you know, started to keep…

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
kick shit up. So there, you know, so there's that.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Let's have a problem. Tim Urban.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Um, huh?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Victoria, as Mike was making some noise, I just muted her.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
I'm sorry, uh, you know…

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:31.000
So, there's a question in that of what is the trajectory or timeframe that we're looking at? And, you know, and the historical cycles and the long trends.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Yep.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Uh, and, um, you know, we tend to pay attention to our own lifetimes here.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Um, it's… it's particularly disturbing now, because my lifetime has been mostly, until recently, a history of what I would consider progress.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Social progress. Um…

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
But, you know, clearly backsliding now. So there's that whole dimension, but I wanted to respond to Alex about growth.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
or to whoever about growth.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Um, because clearly, you know, we now live in a system that privileges growth.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:10.000
You know, if I'm a corporation, my profits grew, you know, my revenues grew 5% last year, and somebody else grew 5.2% last year, I'm in the shithouse.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So there's that game.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:23.000
On the other hand, degrowth denies the biological reality of every organism is designed to feed and reproduce and propagate, so there's a natural growth in living systems, but it's constrained.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
by resources, competition, and so forth. It's not infinite.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Living systems have a quality called satiation, which human capitalist economic systems seem not to.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Um, you know, a lion goes out to hunt and brings down a wildebeest and drags it back to the pride, and everybody eats, and what do they do next? They don't go out and get another one, they go to sleep.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Because they've eaten enough.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
And we don't have enough here.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Um, but, you know, so the notion of…

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:07.000
I know David, was it you who said that the progress is this relatively recent or specialized concept. Progress was not always a drive in human history.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:15.000
There was care, and there was a growth of a certain kind within resource constraints, but progress as a goal.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
maybe wasn't there.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Um, and so that comes, you know, does that come in with capitalism? Does that come in with technology? Does that come in with certain religions?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Um, um, the notion of betterment in the context of care, you know, I'm going to build a better house, take better care of my family.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000
There's that. There's progress as accumulation of wealth and power, which maybe is a different thing.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And I don't know where else to go with that, but there's a whole territory to explore there.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
And takes it back… takes me back… takes me back to Victoria on my question at the top of the call, which is,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.000
What do we mean by this, anyway?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Love that.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
And that conversation about what do we mean by this and why,

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
is, I think, a more illuminating and provocative question than trying to

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000
determine… put a score on whether there's been a progress or not, because it reveals what we are each caring about.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
I'm complete.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Thanks. So what do we care about?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
What does matter?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Well, I… I don't know why this pops into my head, but sometimes when I'm…

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Wanting to feel grateful. I realized that I… Being naked in a jungle?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
I would probably be worse off. just maybe not for the next 15 minutes.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000
But for the next year. If I survived.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:10.000
And… So, what is progress? Is it… How many people are… not… naked in a jungle?

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I don't know if that is an adequate definition, but I think it's the start.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Of a definition, perhaps, that… There are so many things that we have that are… go back 200 years, did not have.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Go back 500 years, did not have. And hopefully… We find ourselves… Not reversing that.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And finding that our… Offspring are worse off and closer to the jungle.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
That's an unformed thought, but I'm…

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
there's a… Gil, go ahead.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I just wanted to say what I put in the chat, Scott. What's wrong with Naked in the Jungle?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Naked in the Jungle has worked very well for lots of humans for a very, very long time.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Sure has, and none of us would be alive at this age.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Actually, not quite.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Probably.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Mmm, not clear from the archaeological evidence, not clear.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:27.000
It's… it's unclear. I would say unclear is not a rousing… argument for, let's all… Go back to the jungle.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Yeah.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
No, no, no, I'm not saying let's all go back to the jungle, I'm saying that the common meme of…

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:39.000
people naked in the jungle as an indication of a bygone age that was much more terrible than that, as we don't know that.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
That's the, you know, that's the argument that Wengro and Graber wade into early in Dawn of Everything about these two visions of human society.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Okay, fair enough. And…

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And that's one of them.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:55.000
And if we don't know that it's… and we don't… if we don't know that it's worse, we also don't know it was better.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
So really, they don't know. I think.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:10.000
I think that archaeological. data is becoming more and more clear, and the… percentage of… males of breeding age.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
who died of violent means. In almost every ancient society.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:23.000
wasn't, you know, 40% greater, it was 400% greater, or 1000% greater. I put a note in here.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Uh, on that. Clearly, when things are more disrupted, either because.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
You now have hunter-gatherers at war with the agricultural societies.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Which is about 8,000 years ago, then you had an explosion of violence.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
But the data I've seen is pretty concrete. And…

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Mike Graeber and Wengro argue that those phenomena were highly localized and variable, depending on the society and culture.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Not on… not on the era.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Oh, as they say, I mean, the data shows that when there is disruption, whether climatic or.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:14.000
changes in the organization of society. much more violence, but… there's no evidence for a golden age where everybody holds hands and gets along, and my tribe of 300 people don't interact with your tribe, and we all are just very happy.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:25.000
No, no, no, and that's not what they're saying. They're saying that you will find situations where in the same region, you'll find some tribes that are peaceful and some tribes that are warlike, and not interacting with each other. I mean, I don't know the details of this.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
But part of their argument is a much more variable tapestry of human history than what we tend to assume.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
And that it's not like it evolves in a unified way over time, but it's very noisy.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Oh, yeah. I mean, that's…

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
I'm going to… I'm…

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Yeah.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
We are agree… we are agreeing vehemently. You do the average.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Yeah. No, and I'm saying let's not do the average, let's look at the variation, because their argument, I think, is that if there's that variation,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Then there's the possibility of different phenomena arising more or less, and what are the circumstances for that, and how do you nurture that?

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
I'm going to… I'm going to…

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Violently.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
I'm going to thank Alex for…

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Well, again, I think we're agreeing… we're agreeing… I hope it's not violent.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Alright, guys.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Yeah, we'll stop.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
I'm gonna thank Alex for his patience, and go back to, um…

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
the normal order of things.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Stacy, do you want to contribute to that? Because I'm just going to move it slightly.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
just one statement, and it's just to be provocative.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I just want to point out that. this idea about, like, life.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
And living is sort of cultural in nature. There are some.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
I know it's weird, but I actually have met people.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:44.000
that when their loved ones pass. They don't even grieve the way we do, because.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:53.000
their idea of death is very different. So, I just want to point that out, because we all seem to think, like, you know, living in.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
at all costs, like, that is the be-all and end-all.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:04.000
But if you really believe that this is just one page in the book, and you're going on to the next page.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Yeah.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
The thinking shifts. I just wanted to… throw that out there.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Yeah, thank you. It's all our frame of reference. Back to Alex.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Awesome. That was good. Um… that frame, what you just discussed, and it's a great discussion, right?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
is historical progress. So we're comparing with times past.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:29.000
But we're in the now, and we're… One way of thinking, one aspect of this question is.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
do I feel like there's progress? I'm in the moment.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Therefore, my feeling of progress might not be as… I might not feel as much progress.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Maybe progress is happening. If we stand back and… well, maybe in 20 years, when we look back, we'll say, oh, that happened, that happened, that's progress.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
But right now, we're living in it, and… We naturally don't feel.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000
or we demand more. I want flying cars. You know, I want a flying car out there.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Sorry, you know, I'd just love to have one.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Well, the hell of it. Um, and I want suddenly to, I don't know.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
world's greatest battery to be invented. You know, I want this progress. I want cancer to be cured. Boom, just like that.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:24.000
But it takes time. So, historical is one aspect, but what you feel is another aspect, and.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
You're too close to the leading edge to feel it, perhaps.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
And if someone comes up and says, Alex, you're wrong, and I'm feeling it, that's fine.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Somebody should do that just to do it, I mean, really.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
I'm okay with that.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Kidding.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
So, do we want to change our notions of progress? Are we…

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Is progress overheated? Doug?

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:14.000
So, so, yeah. I would, um… offer, um… progress as… Um, an evolutionary maturation of our species such that.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Um. we managed to remember, reconnect with… the larger whole and the more transcendent idea of beyond my survival and self-interest.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:38.000
what's in service to the whole. And, um… that on a… I don't know, vitality.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
in alignment with natural law, in alignment with biome, in alignment with.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
what's in service to life, what's in service to survival?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Um, that it's all of us or none of us.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:06.000
would be progress. And I… and I actually… Um… just to sort of double down on that… Um, would… you know, suggest that.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Um. That is an emergent… It's… it's been an emergent phenomenon at different periods of.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:25.000
transformation, transition, disruption. those ideas percolate through.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
And they tend to be, you know. Uh, delivered by a persona.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000
And they tend to generate global ripples and influences and effects.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Um, and I think part of… Um, part of what might be missing today from.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000
the next, sort of. guiding light and or pointer indicator toward.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:00.000
transitioning out of the dystopic… chaos that we're in in the moment.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Um, is that right now, that global persona is missing.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Like, I don't know that we have a bunch of those.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Um, but they tend to come out of these periods.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Mm-hmm.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
So we're in a modern axial age kind of thing?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Like, they emerge… they percolate out of the… Um, and then… Yeah, and… the messengers, or the channelers, or the bearers of light, um.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:43.000
you know, uh… I think we'll… we'll surface and appear, and right now we're in this period of… the absence of, and for lack thereof, everybody's, like, in chaos.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Victoria, if you want to jump in, you're saying something along these lines…

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
In the chat.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:56.000
I'm curious what your thoughts are.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Victoria, did you hear me?

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
None of… no, no, no, she's unmuting.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Yeah, but you… she's muted. Do you have to unmute her, since you are the one…

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Yeah, yeah, okay. No. Um, I said that.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:17.000
progress for the sake of progress seems like… a vain goal, or a stupid goal, because… you need to know what you are… progressing toward.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:26.000
And then Jerry asked. If, uh, progress was our new god, and I said, no, progress is the gut.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
that made the illustration. the Enlightenment. Sorry.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Enlightenment. Now. We are a very, uh… barriers people, we are not homogeneous. You Americans think one way, and… and I say you Americans because I see you from Europe.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:54.000
But you think different from your neighbor, and… So, some are thinking that.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:20.000
the Church of the Flying Spaghetti saucer, and the others are thinking about economic, uh… sharks, and the others are thinking, going to meditate and feel… So, it's to… their priorities, we are not, uh, Borgs. I don't know if you remember Star Trek and the Borgs?

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Those were the bodies. who were… they integrated everything, but they were, like.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
a single organism. they didn't have individualism.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000
We… we do. We need to find a balance between the individual, the individual, and the society.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
But we have individualism. We are not orgs.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:55.000
And is there a… is there a religion that does that? I mean, FSM, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is impost…

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
It's also known as Pastafarianism, which I… a term I adore.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:09.000
is posed as a fun religion, as a tongue-in-cheek religion, and I own the domain fubarism.com, which is exactly inspired by

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000
The Flying Spaghetti Monster and things like that, but it's meant to be a serious question if you got to invent your own religion,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
What would you put in it?

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Oh, nice!

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.000
I belong to the Judaism, uh… This is the youth, and this is the church of the Judaism. Take it easy.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Awesome!

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Who knew that the… who knew that the big Lebowski was gonna make it into this call?

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.000
There are…

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Um, Pete, please.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Um, I think I wanted to pick up, kind of,

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
where Doug, uh…

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Doug B. was. Um…

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
And it made me think, uh, I like what you said, Doug.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
And I wanted to…

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000
play contrarian for a sec, not because I think it's a good thing, but because we live with…

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
this contrarian thing.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:14.000
We have demonstrably billionaires whose idea… one billionaire's idea of progress is, uh, life…

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
sentience will become multi-planetary.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Um, and that's pretty much the only thing he cares about, really. I mean, he cares about lots of chaos and fun and hooliganism.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Um, but he's been steady on his goal of, uh, life must become

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.000
multi-planetary, you know, down the torpedoes, uh, I don't care who dies or who hates it, or what.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:47.000
We're just gonna do it. Um, we have another billionaire, uh, running the country, running the country, um, who's…

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
His progress for him has been

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:57.000
dominance, um, I can make whatever decision I want, I can say whatever I want, um, I can…

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:06.000
deploy the U.S. military however I want. I can invade whatever I want, in-country or out of country. I can kill whoever I want.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Um, uh, I can destroy whatever building I want, and I can build whatever building I want.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
That's progress for him. So…

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:22.000
And to get to the point where those people could make those kinds of decisions, uh, society-wide decisions,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Um, we had, you know, a few hundred, uh, you know, several centuries of moving up the ladder of…

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Um, the, uh, the golden rule, the people with the most gold get to make the rules.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
And, you know, so we've gotten to the point where

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000
We have progress. A few people make, uh, dramatically…

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Life-altering decisions for…

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.000
billions of people on the rest of the planet, um, and they make the… they make them more or less unilaterally.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Um…

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Uh, so…

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.000
So, at least for some people, you know, we can talk about, well, I wish we could raise the tide for everybody.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
For a few people,

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:21.000
they're thinking, what I care about is that a few people, especially me, are going to be the highest we can get. I can make the most decisions affecting the most number of people,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:28.000
And have the most resources available to me. And I don't care what happens to the rest of the distribution of the population. I really don't.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000
So, just a reflection that, um…

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
the progress…

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Progress is different for different people, and some of us, it's very different, um, in a way that harms everybody else.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Thank you, Pete. Mike, do you want to tell us about how progress ends, the book you just pasted the long link into the chat about?

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Yeah.

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
I've only read the book reviews, so… and it was a biased book review.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So… but I… it's very related. There's… there have been a couple of very good, sort of.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000
libertarian texts on the barriers to progress, not just the one about China.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
But also a couple other, uh, Reason Magazine has done a series of articles on.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
on why we're getting in our way, and why we have to have social progress, as well as.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:31.000
technology breakthrough. I mean, what I've heard from this talk today is reaffirming… reaffirming my statement at the top, which is, I think everybody's.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
agreeing that technology continues to progress. Uh, different in different places.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And that a lot of the focus has been on social progress.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And why… and the lack of social progress is… has held back.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:57.000
so many people from enjoying the benefits. I don't know if anybody saw the Washington… the Wall Street Journal today.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But I was almost moved to tears. It was an article about corruption in South Africa.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000
South Africa has now become the most. economically unequal country in the world.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Which is really quite a feat. And basically, the ruling party.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
In the name of spreading the wealth and, you know, destroying the apartheid system.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:36.000
has just… given most of the… economic activity of the country to a handful of very well-connected people in the, in the, uh… African National Committee.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I mean, it's just the ANC. It's just a corruption machine. And again.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.000
They have progress in South Africa, they certainly have a lot more information technology and great apps, and… People are getting educated better.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
But it isn't showing up in the daily lives of most of the people.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So, you know, maybe in the future we can actually ask that question, and… I'm particularly… concerned about corruption, just eating our society.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Not just in the U.S, but in South Africa. It did in Russia long ago.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And I don't know, I mean, to be positive, maybe we, you know, have a discussion about the few places where people have done something to.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
To push back against corruption, or to build the guardrails.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But even in… even in the Nordic countries, which have always been very transparent and very good about fighting corruption, there is… There's a modern bandit class that seems to be showing up, and… Using the power structure to get more.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Um, it's interesting.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And I just come in on this? Sorry, Jerry.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Uh, go ahead, Alex. Yep.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000
When I come in on this. Mike… I am shocked to hear you say those words that you just said. They're great.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I believe them, but I considered myself to be a… A conspiracy theorist has these thoughts, honestly.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I'm shocked that you just said them. I literally have spent my life… well, not my life, the last few years, saying to people.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Wake up, you know, there's something wrong with the way… the system is.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And, uh, you know, I'll call it, uh, what is it?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000
currently capitalism, but, you know, it's… I'm… I'm… I'm impressed. I'm really pleased that you said that.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Yeah, well, we should, as I say, I think… How to defeat crony capitalism.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
would be a very interesting topic, because it would get us focused on what's going on, and get us.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Rather than saying, how do we reinvent capitalism? just focus on that one piece of the puzzle.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Um, I love that question. I think it's a great question.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
One of the reasons that I've had

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
a couple of side calls and a couple of topics around

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
governance, like what works in governance, for example, and then, uh, I have a

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
thing I call the next two stacks. What are our new stacks?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
is that centralization tends to corrupt, absolute centralization corrupts absolutely.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
to paraphrase Lord Acton.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And, you know,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:23.000
in… in Russia, a peasant from the Republic of Georgia can take over the whole thing because they've designed a pyramid.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
that has complete authority at the top without any checks.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And then you have, like, a whole bunch of bad stuff happens, and everywhere we see

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
those kinds of structures arise, they…

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
tend to not play out very well, so I was hunting for…

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And I'm still very much hunting for.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
What is the new stack of things that communities…

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Large and small can choose from and adopt voluntarily.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
that would do things like…

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Increased prosperity, raise the sustainability of their biosphere or their watershed.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
help them conquer corruption.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And defeat… expose and defeat corruption.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
make them… one of the problems with

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Pacifist societies living next to warring societies,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
is that… is that the warring societies tend to have better weapons and less, less, uh, morality.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
So they come tromping in. And this is the story of human history written

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
writ large, unfortunately.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:26.000
is that all too often, the people who see something nice happening next door just go in and take it.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And so how do you make it very… how do you turn communities into porcupines?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000
or pufferfish, so that when someone tries to ingest them, they have to barf them back out.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I'm really interested in Taiwan.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
How might Taiwan turn itself into a pufferfish?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Ukraine kind of is, but it's not really working. I mean, it's pretty clear to me that most Ukrainians

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
would absolutely hate and undermine

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
a regime under Putin, with every… to their dying breath, that it is…

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
such a poison, such a poisoned relationship that they would, you know, stand up.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000
But, um… but how do we do the opposite? How do we create

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Or how do we compose or make available a bunch of things that actually make for a better life?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And bake into them.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
some set of things, and I don't know if that means

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:30.000
some kind of verifiable identity on the blockchain, I don't… I don't know, that's beyond my pay grade. I don't know if that means other kinds of things, but I'm extremely interested in that.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I think that we're… and the lack

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
of a stack like that means that when the Arab Spring happens,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And all of North Africa basically overturns their governments,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
A couple decades later, they are no better off.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Because nobody had a thing they could reach for,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
that would stop the corruption from taking over, the powers that be from before, from coming back and just

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
adopting new clothing, but still running the country, all those kinds of things.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
So, it's a little depressing to look at how human history

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
has failed to progress in those ways.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
But I think it's very possible, but it needs to be done in some…

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
much more distributed, decentralized way.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I look to the, you know, Fetiverse and IndieWeb and decentralization on the net,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
as maybe examples, but I'm not sure.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
the crypto world doesn't feel to me like the answer. So for me, a part of the betterverse

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
All right.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Did you?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
involves… evolving these kinds of stacks and having serious conversations to make these things better and better over time.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Sorry, Mike, go ahead.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Because of this discussion, I just discovered that there is a museum of political corruption.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Oh, nice!

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Yeah, I don't know if it's real, I don't know if it's a physical place, it could just be a, um… A virtual museum.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But they do have halls of shame and halls of honor.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
That is great, thank you.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Pretty cool. I put the link.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000
You're not, uh, without… without any actual proof, because… but… my uncle's passed along.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
like, 50 years ago, when we used to talk politics and corruption, because I was in Africa, so it was all corruption, whatever.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I love that. Um, he used to say, but Alex, you have to grow your thinking.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
He said, the difference between Africa and we used to live in Greece, and here is.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Corruption happens here. It's just more sophisticated. And as you go, say, to the British, they're even more sophisticated.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
You don't see it, but corruption is a endemic across all societies.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So I wonder… I wonder how people feel about that.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Because that's my feeling, is there's a lot of corruption everywhere, it's just… transparent here, not so trans… you know, a bit obtuse or opaque over there.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
It all depends on how much shame there is.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And I know one reason Nigeria has been. a epicenter for online scamming.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
is because… when it first started happening.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
there was a celebration of these scams. The scammers were almost national heroes.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.000
one of the first things that happened in this regard wasn't on the internet, because the internet wasn't really there.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000
there were some guys sending faxes. to the World Bank.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And they were… they were… they were offering these special deals. Oh my god, I just need a million dollars, and then we can unlock all this money, and we can give you the finder's fee, and… It was exactly the same thing that's going on.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:49.000
25, 30 years later. But there was a sense of, you know, the… the Robin Hood. You know, let's take money from these rich countries and, you know, we'll spend it here.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And that's why there's 100,000 people in Nigeria. in the online scamming business.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I think it's a little bit like, uh, the narcotraficantes in Mexico, because there are narco ridas, or something like that?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
There's basically a genre of Norteno music that celebrates

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
that celebrates the Nautical Cartels, because they are an economic success of some sort.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Can I… sorry.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Bring money back into the community. I mean, it's… there are indirect benefits to the… Average person in the street.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Yeah.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
If they're not caught in the middle of the crossfire.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Can I ask this question? Because we shouldn't discuss this, because it's a different topic, but… On the issue of Nigeria being.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
scam capital for that reason, which is good. In the 90s, I remember.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Canada was also. a big source of scamming schemes to do with shares.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000
owning shares and whatever. And I don't know if that's… but the mechanics must be totally different there.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And why Canada? And since then, they actually… trying to look at, you know, get rid of it or whatever.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So I don't know if there's any… anything more in Canada versus anywhere else in the world.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
But it just fascinates me that. it hopped across.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Well, one reason, and I'm sorry, Doug, it's your turn, but one… The reason that Canada and the Caribbean.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Oh, sorry, Doug, I didn't see it, sir.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000
our hotbeds of phone scams. is that they share the same… country code with us.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So they're also, you know, country code 1. And so, these little countries, little islands, look like a local call.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So we have the North American Numbering Plan to blame for this.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Good lord!

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Good lord!

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
from another American. It's… I'm not making this up. This is… this is… Yeah.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
You sound like Dave Berry. I am not making this up.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Love Dave Berry.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I am not making that… this is real, he… he… he…

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
made a lot of headway on humor from real life.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Uh, Doug, please.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I, um… What came up for me, um… A colleague of mine.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:22.000
had a lot of contact with the Kogis. Which is an Indigenous tribe, and they… They have gone on these missions to Europe and around the world to raise money to buy their land back, basically.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:34.000
their ecosystem and regional. you know, uh… territory. And so they go on these trips to raise money, basically.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And… Um, over the course of the trips, and there are these mamins, there were this sort of, um.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:49.000
the leaders of the tribe and direct connect to source, and… And they sort of channel.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000
you know, what's needed and what's next, and decision-making and all the rest.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And over the course of several trips, you know, one of the Mamans was sort of.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Corrupted. You know, exposed to Western conveniences and Western this, and Western that, and… You know, they had to sort of pull him out.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:25.000
of the travel core. Uh, to, you know, re… reintegrate him back into the tribal… um, you know.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Gestalt. And… you know, so the… so the question… the question for me is.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
you know, what is that pull? about.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:52.000
you know, what is… what is the… literal corruption on a sole basis, on a values basis, on an identity basis.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Um, because… Corrupting is the verb.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And what's being corrupted when people become corrupt? you know, what in their makeup, what in their identity, what in their awareness or consciousness?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:18.000
is either turned off or is neutralized, or is negated, or is… abandoned or stunted, or missing.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Uh, in terms of an individual's makeup. Um, that renders them corruptible.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And the question… and sort of the flip side question, which is.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Um, what strengthens, you know. cultural and societal.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.000
alignment on our values and… And, uh, and relational level.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:51.000
that renders a culture or a society. Um, somewhat more Teflon or immune.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:58.000
to influences that corrupt the fabric that binds. So, with that, I'm complete.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Thanks, Doug. It feels like you've just described half of Western literature.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I'm like, oh man, so many good plots came out of what you just said.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Jerry, could I jump in? Because we've got to leave for a doctor's appointment.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Just please, the man in the hat.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I just want to add it.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Yeah, just a quick comment before Ken shows up with a poem. Um, what…

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I don't know that he is, but…

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I don't know either, but it's a ritual thing. What Doug said reminds me of Doris Lessing's notion of the substance of weed feeling.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
that she talked about in the remarkable Shikasta trilogy.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And that appears or breaks in society. Is that, you know, that notion of a kind of mutual care, responsibility, and so forth. That's an anti-corruption.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:50.000
component. And last, on the matter of corruption, I'm… I'm a biomimicist. I tend to look at the 3.8 billion years of open source R&D that Earth's living systems have generated.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Um, that's available for us for free.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
to draw from if we choose to.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Uh, but if I look at those systems, I see that parasitism and predation

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
are part of the game.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And so what we've been calling corruption is our… is the name that we are giving to that phenomenon.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And maybe that phenomenon is natural and inevitable.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And then what? Or maybe it's something that is natural and inevitable, like in living systems, is constrained and limited, or self-limiting.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000
parasites can't destroy the host, because they die if they do.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Uh, part of the problem with our modern systems is that we don't have the

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I don't even know what the word for it. We don't have the kind of coupling between systems, the appropriate feedback loops, and so forth, that provide the damping.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000
and constraint of these inevitable phenomena. So they go haywired.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And that's where we are now, and I… Doug… Doug, I like your phrase, but I can't say I'm complete, because I'm not, but there you are. I'm done speaking, at least.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
We could end with, and I'm incomplete.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And thank you, everybody. We have to leave. I'll catch you on the recording. Bye-bye.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Thanks. Thanks, Gil.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Take care.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000
And we only have a few minutes left in this particular call.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Anybody want to summarize, uh…

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
plot a path forward, uh…

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
critique, uh, whatever you'd like.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000
For what it's worth, I… go toe-to-toe with Yale from time to time.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But I do definitely agree with him on this, and it's something I've been trying to.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
wrestle with is the idea of. seeing the system.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:50.000
accepting the system. And then… Deciding what you want to do, but understanding that.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
As he said, some of these things just… they exist.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And our hubris that we could… somehow create a system of 8 billion where it doesn't… exist seems… like a… Perhaps that the wrong direction.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
How do we… how do we dance with it?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.000
instead of damning it. You know, how do you surf on the wave instead of.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:34.000
trying to have a still pond. I don't know, that's all just… spontaneous out of my brain there, so… I'm not sure where that's going, but I think that there's something important.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
about saying, we need to have a world where these things don't exist.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Versus, we need to live in a world where these things do exist.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
as long as we're doing that dance to go to something else skill set in the chat.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000
He made the distinction between corruption and scamming, which I think is an important one.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Because corruption is something done by the powerful, we're scamming. There is a lack of power, which is why they have to scam in the first place.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I mean, I… I think that there's a difference there.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And if you're gonna look at the whole dance.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I think you have to look at that piece, too.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
That's a really interesting distinction.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
often a scam, though, leads to power and money that then goes back into corruption, so there's…

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It's a little infinite loop, yeah. And then you do… and then you do jail time, lose your money, and you have to go back to scamming, I mean…

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But it's fluid.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's like a little infinite cycle.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Whatever it is, it's fluid, and so…

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000
It's… the point's… the point is exactly right, but there's no way to separate the two.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
It's a…

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I don't know… what I'm hearing from Stacy, though, Stacy, clarification. Are you seeing a… are you… We're referencing a sense of scale in that.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:52.000
To me, corruption feels… larger and more coordinated and scamming feels more…

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I'm just saying… I'm not even… I'm not even answering the question. I'm just raising the question.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And just bringing it out, just saying. Let's look at the whole thing.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
you know. I'm just asking the question.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
The root is often the same, the fact that people.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:20.000
have no shame. And I mentioned the Nigerian case, the scamming happened because.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:27.000
well, I think they… understood the idea of shame, and there were a lot of religious people who thought that that was stealing.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:35.000
There was also a sense of… hey, we're taking money that was stolen from us.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Right, and I'm also…

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000
So… so there. And I do worry that we have… I mean, that would be a great question, too. You know, have we reached the end of shame?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And with certain members of the political class here in Washington, starting with.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Mike Johnson and J.D. Vance. They clearly have no shame.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Actually, shamelessness is a positive strategy of the far right.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It's a very intentional thing.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's a really intentional thing, and it's working like crazy.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And this is a tangent, but it worries me no end, because nonviolent social action

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Absolutely depends on shame.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Yep. And it's George…

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Absolutely depends on shame. You're counting on… you're counting on people seeing how crappy those people's behavior is and being ashamed and changing their minds, and…

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Voting differently, or overthrowing the government, or whatever. But if we're entering the post-shame era,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I'm afraid a lot of our assumptions about what might work and how to do things

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000
might just break, might not work at all, and that's got me pretty scared.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I marched in the No Kings March here in Washington, and a lot of the posters.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Yeah, no.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
assumed that shame was still a powerful force. But you're right. If George Santos.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:57.000
can have… be given leniency. And all these Republicans are like, oh yeah, right, you're right.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000
That means shame is gone. I mean, this guy, I mean, he stole from tens of thousands of… Good, loyal Republicans.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
as Trump has over and over again.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Go ahead, Stacy.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Pete, can I just say one thing? Just one thing really quickly. Even when you say something like, shame is gone, I just want to remind you, yes, shame is gone in that way, but now.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:23.000
shame about their sexuality. They have that. So when we make these blanket statements, I just want us to remember that.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yes, if we're looking at one thing, it's true, but we can look at something else, and it's not true.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And that's something that we humans seem to do a lot. We make this blanket statement.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:42.000
And we don't recognize that if we flip it around.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Love that. Thank you, Stacey.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
It's absolutely a wrong statement.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Pete?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Um, it's, uh, it's terrible that we've lost the sense of shame in politics. It's really…

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000
striking and horrifying. Um, and I… on corruption, I…

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I… that's a really interesting topic, and I…

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
want to make sure that we…

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:13.000
don't… don't end up aiming for zero corruption. I think, um, in…

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
in any complicated system, there's going to be some

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:26.000
some grafting corruption, and if it's done right, it actually kind of lubricates the whole system and keeps it going. Um, it's when…

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
It's when the, uh, corrupted folks

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
don't have a sense of shame or proportion, or balance, or something like that.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
that it… it grows and turns into something malevolent.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
It's kind of like, it reminds me of living in a world with a lot of…

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
viruses and bacterias and stuff like that, you know, if everything is kind of like…

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000
homeostatic, then, you know, it's like, yeah, your body kind of deals with it. It's actually good

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
To have a little bit of low-level irritation going on.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Um, but when it gets out of control, you know, when some kind of balance goes off, then it's bad.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Um, the reason I raised my hand was because, Jerry, when you said it

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
you know, is there anything we want to wrap up with? Um, I… the thing my… one of my

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
top carry takeaways from this was, um, Mike said something like, uh,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
how to defeat crony capitalism would be a great topic, and I want to second that. That's a…

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That seems like it kind of, like, narrows down and fits a lot of stuff. So, I wanna…

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Raise my hand for that.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Love that. And, uh, next Thursday is not the first of the month yet.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
So, I think we've found our topic for the 30th.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Thank you for that.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Yes, that or… that or a benediction.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Can I offer a slight tweak? Instead of… in… Instead of defeating crony capitalism, how about rendering it obsolete?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Even better. Even better.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Sounds great.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I'm changing the wording in my notes.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
This has been really fun. Thank you for, um…

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Thank you for joining, and as usual, Victoria, thank you for joining us.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You're very happy you're here.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
We are… we are really glad to have you here, and…

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:34.000
The duking it out in the… everywhere in the chat, in the conversation worked wonderfully, so thank you.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Anyone else with a closing thought?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
We don't have Ken for a while, uh…

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
With a poem, sadly. So, Victoria Ken Homer has been a long-standing member of this group, and he's sort of decided to step out of things for a

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
for a bit. He's also moving.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
to Spain, I think. I think he and his wife are moving to Valencia.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And he had this… he is, uh…

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Wanted to be an actor when he was young, so he has a great presence and speaking voice, and also loves poetry, so he would find poems and read them to us at the end of…

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:13.000
a lot of OGM calls, so if you've watched the recordings, you'll see poems at the end. If you go through my notes in the brain, you'll find for every OGM call, I'll link up to the poem that

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Ken read to us.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And it's been a really lovely custom. If anybody else feels like picking up that, uh…

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000
that, uh… I was gonna say duty, it's not a duty, it's, uh…

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
It's a mission, it's a…

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Honor.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Something else. Honor.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
We would be grateful. And in some cases, he would read us his original poetry, which was…

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Time as he would write his own poems.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Stellar. Just stellar.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:50.000
So, thank you all, and we'll see you next week when we'll talk about how to deflate, diffuse, defeat, not defeat, disarm crony capitalism.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Absolutely, that's it. That's in my notes.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
I forgot the word. Thanks.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000
it obsolete.
