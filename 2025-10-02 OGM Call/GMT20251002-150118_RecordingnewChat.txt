It isn’t about the social graph. 
It’s about groups and how we things together and how we are accountable to each other.

00:46:57	Scott Moehring:	RE: Pete’s comment about it being difficult to find out what people are doing, and Jerry’s comment about Vince being busy his own stuff, I recently looked up a guy on LinkedIn, a successful serial entrepreneur, very interesting guy to me, with lots of articles and interviews by others featuring him about what he’s doing. 

What jumped out at me that there was a message at the top of his page that said “Robin hasn’t posted yet”. I was surprised, but then it occurred to me he might be busy working on his companies, not self-posting stuff about working on his companies. 

It made me take a look at my own ratio of how much I’m doing versus how much I’m trying to tell people about what I’m doing.
