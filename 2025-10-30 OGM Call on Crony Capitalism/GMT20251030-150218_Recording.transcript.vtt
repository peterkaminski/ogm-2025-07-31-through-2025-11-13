00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.960
Jerry Michalski: This is the OGM Open Global Mind Weekly Call for Thursday, October 30th.

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.520
Jerry Michalski: 2025…

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.360
Jerry Michalski: Did I get the year right? Yep. How did we get… I don't know how we got into 2025 already, it's a quarter of the century.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.180
Jerry Michalski: It's happening fast. It's going by real quick.

5
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.089
Jerry Michalski: We were,

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:32.950
Jerry Michalski: Just commenting on marsupials. So, how clever, how clever the program is that you're born a little worm, you go out, you attach yourself to a nutrition, and then grow up.

7
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:45.069
Jerry Michalski: Has anybody been, like, up close and personal with a kangaroo or a wallaby that has a Joey in its pouch? Like, a pretty grown Joey with little legs sticking out of the pouch?

8
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:58.820
Jerry Michalski: it's like it's carrying a nearly, nearly full-grown kangaroo in there. And the Joey… the joey just, like, dives in, does, like, a little cannonball in, and its feet are completely sticking out. You're like, wow, that looks uncomfortable.

9
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.459
Mike Nelson: for both parties.

10
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.780
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, yeah, well, Joy loves it.

11
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:13.319
Jerry Michalski: And April and I got to feed wallabies and ruse, when we were at a little wild park in Australia, and they are tame and delight… they're cool.

12
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.849
Jerry Michalski: They were very sweet.

13
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.669
Jerry Michalski: Welcome, everybody. Eric, nice to see you.

14
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.169
Jerry Michalski: Even though you're on a call right now. We have as our topic

15
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.800
Jerry Michalski: How to render crony capitalism obsolete.

16
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.700
Jerry Michalski: which, mike, was it your thought last week?

17
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:42.720
Mike Nelson: Well, I was talking about crony capitalism. We did a lot of wordsmithing and got lots of good ideas on which piece of this to dive into, but…

18
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.539
Mike Nelson: For my money, crony capitalism and disinformation

19
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:56.380
Mike Nelson: are two of the drivers of all the bad things that are going on in the world right now. Whether it's wars, or Trump, or…

20
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.199
Mike Nelson: Repression of human rights in country after country. It's just…

21
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.570
Mike Nelson: That's what you gotta do if you want to maintain that network of dark money and, illegal activity.

22
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.689
Jerry Michalski: Was there no crony capitalism under progressives?

23
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.499
Mike Nelson: Oh, no, I think, I mean, Maduro considers himself, you know, a leftist.

24
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.530
Jerry Michalski: I would think that the MAGA critique of the left is that it was crony capitalism.

25
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.920
Mike Nelson: Well, coming.

26
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.129
Jerry Michalski: of the progressive American left.

27
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:40.770
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, we got two… we got at least two different themes here. We got one is capitalism, and one is cronyism, and they… and maybe you want to take socialism in the mix, too, and combine them in various ways.

28
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.130
Jerry Michalski: Perhaps. Well, I'm.

29
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.530
Mike Nelson: Well, I think crony socialism is a form of crony capitalism, because it's all about the capital. Follow the money.

30
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.829
Mike Nelson: I mean, it's socialism in air quotes.

31
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.510
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

32
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.729
Mike Nelson: I mean, Marxism never got a chance.

33
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.289
Jerry Michalski: But certainly what's happening in Russia, for example.

34
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.060
Jerry Michalski: is crony commune capitalism, or something like that? Because, the Sloviki is the name for…

35
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:25.870
Jerry Michalski: Putin's former buddies from the FSB and the KGB and all those things, who basically went out and own a lot of the… when they privatized all the enterprises, a lot of those people went out to run those enterprises. And they scratch each other's backs, and I think…

36
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.460
Jerry Michalski: I think one of the reasons Putin has such control over Russia still, even though he's eaten more than 1.25…

37
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.690
Jerry Michalski: plus million Russians dead in this conflict is one of the estimates.

38
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:52.459
Jerry Michalski: which is astonishing to me. They only lost, like, 20,000 people in Afghanistan after 10 years, and they left. So the numbers are completely staggering to me, that that many Russians can have died, and this is still a thing.

39
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.830
Jerry Michalski: But I think the Siloviki are a reason why he can stay in power.

40
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.980
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Jerry, why would you remotely call that communist?

41
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.369
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There doesn't seem to be anything communist about it anymore since the fall.

42
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:22.039
Jerry Michalski: I… yes, except there's, like, this, it's like, there's a German term, Ostalgi, which is nostalgia for the old Ost regime, the former East Germany. It seems like Putin is trying to regrow the former Soviet Union.

43
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:35.359
Jerry Michalski: and happen… and using capitalism as a handy mechanism to do it, even though it's not that capitalist or democratic or anything anymore, right? So I don't know what to call… it's a kleptocracy, I guess. It's…

44
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.950
Jerry Michalski: doesn't fall neatly into any category. So it's not communism anymore, but it feels like there's some weird mutt mix of stuff.

45
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.789
Mike Nelson: Just to correct a statistic, Jerry, the 1.2 million number is casualties, not.

46
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.059
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, I thought it was dead.

47
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:07.639
Jerry Michalski: There's an estimate that's been growing ever since the war started, and it just… it crossed a million a while ago, and it may be a Ukraine-biased estimate, but it's not casualties, it's debt.

48
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.800
Mike Nelson: No, it's CSIS…

49
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:20.410
Mike Nelson: indicates that it was up to a quarter of a million people dead, total casualties. Well, and that… this was a couple months ago, but…

50
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.900
Jerry Michalski: Okay?

51
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.529
Mike Nelson: Yeah, it is. But a quarter of a million dead, I mean, that's… I mean, that's incredible.

52
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.450
Jerry Michalski: Still huge. Yeah, yeah.

53
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.320
Mike Nelson: And they have half the population of the U.S.

54
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.089
Mike Nelson: Yeah, that was as of June in the Guardian.

55
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:49.779
Jerry Michalski: So our topic is crony capitalism, and we don't need to… I dragged this into Putin land because I was trying to figure out, so what is this thing? You know, how to… that seems to be a version of crony capitalism.

56
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.380
Mike Nelson: The most extreme version, I would say, other than maybe North Korea and, and I guess…

57
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.750
Jerry Michalski: the North.

58
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.789
Mike Nelson: Assad's Syria.

59
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:14.490
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, but I don't think North Korea would claim to be capitalist, where Russia would claim to be capitalist now, right? So it is, I think, the most extreme version. And I wanted to bring into the conversation pretty quickly, people like Lawrence Lessig.

60
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.180
Jerry Michalski: And his Root Strikers efforts. Lawrence has,

61
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:35.219
Jerry Michalski: Lawrence has not had much success over the years, but he's been fighting the noble fight against exactly these kinds of things for years. He lost Eldred versus Reno way back in the day, which was a copyright

62
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.510
Jerry Michalski: case that went to the Supreme Court that was a terrible loss. I really regret that that happened.

63
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.270
Jerry Michalski: Copyright just.

64
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.330
Mike Nelson: The world would have been different.

65
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.900
Jerry Michalski: for that.

66
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:57.259
Mike Nelson: Yeah, world would have been different, exactly. But even while he was doing that, I was convincing him that that's not gonna… not gonna work. I mean, the corruption caused by the copyright industry…

67
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:08.119
Mike Nelson: is what's driving the politics of copyright and the policy. And it is, it's blatant corruption. I mean, it's really, really bad how, I mean, these…

68
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:24.160
Mike Nelson: Senators and congressmen are promised great jobs when they leave, and they get, you know, they end up, you know, million-dollar-a-year jobs running trade associations for RIAA and Motion Picture Association of America.

69
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.830
Mike Nelson: but also just, I mean, it's… it's incredible how they…

70
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.650
Mike Nelson: invite almost every White House staffer to

71
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:51.849
Mike Nelson: movies at their special, exclusive preview theater five blocks from the White House, and it's just… it's not… it's not that they're just focusing on the people who make the policy, they're… they're blanketing the… so that everybody thinks the movie industry is the most important industry in America.

72
00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:05.170
Jerry Michalski: So I'm curious, let's pause what we've said so far, and let's get a little read of the room. Under the topic of crony capitalism, what paths would anybody like to take into the topic?

73
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.820
Jerry Michalski: Le… let's not assume away. Go ahead, John.

74
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.930
* John Kelly: Alright, so this is… this is, I will admit, big. I mean, so…

75
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.910
Jerry Michalski: Never go for big. What do you do?

76
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.260
* John Kelly: Indulgence.

77
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.780
* John Kelly: So that,

78
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:29.189
* John Kelly: You know, of course, there's the transaction, economic transactions, and all the things that go with that. You know, measurement, precision,

79
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:37.880
* John Kelly: gross ignoring of important non-monetary values, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a whole world over here of economics, alright?

80
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.850
* John Kelly: Then there's this world over here of, democracy, policy.

81
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.650
* John Kelly: And there's this attempt to, you know.

82
00:08:47.840 --> 00:09:04.879
* John Kelly: keep the two separate. There's this idea that, well, people should be able to express their intentions, and those intentions should have consequences, and that should work, you know? And it's very fragile, and we all know how it breaks down.

83
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.970
* John Kelly: Then there's this weird kind of middle territory that I'm gonna talk about, and it's,

84
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:20.560
* John Kelly: it has different… there are different models here. One… one model is, you know, reputational economies.

85
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:26.400
* John Kelly: Where people have influence, That's a function of their reputation.

86
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.740
* John Kelly: And there's, of course, we've seen the most, you know.

87
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.230
* John Kelly: Problematic and obscene versions of this, in terms of the social media-like

88
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.890
* John Kelly: Button, their number of followers, influencers, all that kind of stuff.

89
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.819
* John Kelly: But I just want to kind of put that on the table, put it over there, and say, okay.

90
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:53.229
* John Kelly: what would it look like if we had a diff… is there something missing? Is there something in the space here that's missing, that if we could make it, it would…

91
00:09:53.460 --> 00:10:01.700
* John Kelly: solve the crony capitalism problem and the disinformation problem. And the idea I'm thinking of is something like…

92
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:10.559
* John Kelly: a, everybody has… and not everybody has a vote, everybody has influence.

93
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.129
* John Kelly: And some people do have more influence than others, but it's bounded.

94
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:29.659
* John Kelly: you cannot be taken down to zero influence, and you cannot have more influence than some amount, you know? And, how do we get influence? Well, in an ideal world, you would actually earn…

95
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:42.550
* John Kelly: your social capital, not the way the Chinese do it, by saying, oh, well, you didn't say anything bad about… and you didn't jaywalk, but actually by doing things that contribute to the community.

96
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:59.619
* John Kelly: And… and how would we keep track of this? Well, that's a… there's a whole set of messy issues here. I think… I think if it's in the hands of the government, no, you know, or the hands of a corporation. I think it has to be a kind of a quasi-public entity.

97
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:08.920
* John Kelly: And, anyhow, this, this thing, this, this reputational economy can periodically

98
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:15.039
* John Kelly: be fired at certain social problems. The way… kind of the way a…

99
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:23.149
* John Kelly: Civic Assembly does now. You know, we isolate an issue, we isolate some people, we say, you know, you've been selected.

100
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.900
* John Kelly: You come out with a position on this. By the way, try to get a position that has

101
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:46.219
* John Kelly: supermajority acceptance within your group, and then it'll have a chance in the regular system. So, I mean, this is a cluster of characteristics, and I admit that it's very loose and very messy, but I'm wondering if there is something

102
00:11:46.340 --> 00:12:01.640
* John Kelly: in the way of a reputational economy that's not controlled by the government, it's not controlled by corporations, it has limits, top and bottom. There's a degree of influence below which you cannot be lowered, nor above which you cannot attain.

103
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:18.739
* John Kelly: And that does have some input to something like what we would call an election, but not with the binary decisiveness of our current elections, more like a tuning, more like a, okay, it's October, and we're now gonna tune, and, you know, guess what?

104
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:32.659
* John Kelly: this thing you're trying to do, it's not… you know, you should do something else, you know. It's some kind of way of nudging the public sphere with the reputational economy.

105
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.490
* John Kelly: Very messy idea, I admit.

106
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:43.720
Jerry Michalski: That's okay. John, have you looked at liquid democracy? I have, yeah. I have, yeah. Is there an overlap there, or are you talking about something.

107
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.780
* John Kelly: Yeah, yeah, there is an overlap, yeah, and there's the,

108
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:59.739
* John Kelly: I'm not recalling whether the version that I looked at had the reputational assignment. In other words, like, you pick somebody who has your vote on… in certain areas. Is that also part of Liquid, or is that something else?

109
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:06.480
Jerry Michalski: I think… I think you kind of proxy… you proxy your vote, or at least you sort of join people whose opinions you agree with.

110
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:06.860
* John Kelly: Yup.

111
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.520
Jerry Michalski: And that sort of moves, and then you can see how many people are

112
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.859
Jerry Michalski: are going around, the different opinions. Go ahead, Eric.

113
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:24.280
Erik Willekens: Correct, correct, I used to be… I used to be in a private party that was actually building on, literally, the software system that would do this, yeah.

114
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.040
Jerry Michalski: Thanks. So, go ahead, John.

115
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:40.790
* John Kelly: Okay, so just, you know, I mean, I know that it's very messy raw material, but it's just raw material from which to potentially build something that is in between, civic elections and economic transactions.

116
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.969
* John Kelly: But then hesitation.

117
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:42.490
Jerry Michalski: Sorry.

118
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:50.559
Jerry Michalski: I wish our friend David Bavill were on this call, because he did a lot of work in liquid democracy early on, is quite familiar with it.

119
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.149
Jerry Michalski: Et cetera, et cetera.

120
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.910
* John Kelly: Yup.

121
00:13:53.620 --> 00:14:04.790
Jerry Michalski: I also wish Grace were here, because according to Kalia, a lot of the work that she and Grace and others are doing with identity systems and other kinds of things, I think, move toward what you're talking about, John?

122
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.150
* John Kelly: Yup.

123
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.089
Jerry Michalski: It would be interesting to know.

124
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.889
Jerry Michalski: Gil, please.

125
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.029
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, thanks. Well, let's,

126
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:29.140
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Let's invite Grace and Kalia and other folks back for a specific call focused on that, perhaps. John, what you say is messy and fascinating at the same time. I can't imagine how you think about something that's not controlled by government or corporations, since those control each other.

127
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:39.630
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I'm not sure where cancel culture fits into the scheme that you're sketching, but all that aside, I wanted to respond to Jerry's question about the framing.

128
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.969
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I think we need to look at,

129
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:54.619
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: If we're looking at crony capitalism and these phenomena, we have to consider what of these arise out of capitalism, and what of these arise out of cronyism, which is maybe an innate human quality in human cultures, or maybe not.

130
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.539
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But where do we see that, and where do we not see that?

131
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:16.050
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, I want to tease those apart, if we're going to look at these, because I think each of them offers a very rich mess, if you will. And just by way of housekeeping, I'm going to switch to phone at the half hour, and I'll go off the call at the top of the hour, got a doctor's appointment, but I'll stay with as long as I can, and thank you.

132
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.989
Jerry Michalski: Awesome. Did you want to dive into the separation you're looking for more?

133
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:35.819
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't know… well, I don't have anything formulated on that, but I think what the phenomenon that we're talking about arises out of both of those.

134
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.329
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And so I guess I… yeah, I guess where I go is the question that I… that I…

135
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.490
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Pardon me.

136
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.280
Jerry Michalski: the question I ended with, which is.

137
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:49.640
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: To what degree is cronyism a, a, you know,

138
00:15:50.290 --> 00:16:08.769
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: common, if not universal, aspect of human affairs, or the other side of that question is, where do we not see cronyism arising, and what sorts of societies and cultures do we not see cronyism as a phenomenon? So maybe we can kind of, you know, back out of the question into looking at some of the fundamental roots of it.

139
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:24.529
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And then we can get to, you know, does capitalism or modern capitalism or American capitalism give rise to more of that, or what are the phenomena that have more cronyism arise or not within the variety of capitalist societies that we have currently on the planet?

140
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.630
Jerry Michalski: So, maybe we need to redefine our definitions a little bit, too.

141
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:38.620
Jerry Michalski: It's cronyism when Significant chunks of business or control or power are given to our

142
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:53.210
Jerry Michalski: buddies and allies. Is that the definition of cronyism? Meaning, we always try to vote for people we like, etc. I mean, human relations are all about who you trust and who you're gonna, you know, bring in to do stuff. The question is, do they get the rewards?

143
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.139
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We do favors for our friends.

144
00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:01.710
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, we bend rules and protocols and so forth for people that we like.

145
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:18.200
Jerry Michalski: So we used to have the spoils system. In this country, the spoil system was, to the victor belong the spoils, is the saying. And if you won the election, you got to put your people in everywhere. And then we created legislation to stop that.

146
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.760
Mike Nelson: We're mixing a lot of things together.

147
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.490
Jerry Michalski: Yes.

148
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:34.559
Mike Nelson: And they're all interrelated, which is why we have to discuss the whole picture. But you just pointed out that they're…

149
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:48.259
Mike Nelson: There's cronyism in government, and then there's cronyism in the marketplace. And in both cases, the test of whether you have crony capitalism is whether friendships

150
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.960
Mike Nelson: are more important.

151
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.110
Mike Nelson: and alliances.

152
00:17:52.590 --> 00:18:00.600
Mike Nelson: Are more important and have more impact than market forces or good policy.

153
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:16.109
Mike Nelson: And it's hard to draw that line, but that's kind of the test that I use when I say, oh, well, that country is characterized by crony capitalism. They're clearly doing bad policy that favors a few people.

154
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.420
Mike Nelson: And generates a lot of profit for them that they have

155
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.640
Mike Nelson: No right to have in a fair free market.

156
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.170
Mike Nelson: So the two are related. You can almost think of it as a circle, where

157
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:38.400
Mike Nelson: The policy is decided. That allows and enables projects. Projects enable profits.

158
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.319
Mike Nelson: For the select few.

159
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.309
Mike Nelson: That then influences the policy all over again.

160
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:49.090
Mike Nelson: So the money is changing hands as it goes from the government.

161
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.489
Mike Nelson: To the, to the people who are implementing these projects, which…

162
00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:12.640
Mike Nelson: because they often have a monopoly, or have some other type… way to control competition, they get the huge profits, and then they buy the legislature and hire the prime minister's son. I mean, it's just… it's… it's an ever-ending circle.

163
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.060
Mike Nelson: And in a lot of countries.

164
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:23.449
Mike Nelson: For 200 years, they had that circle, and there was a understanding that there was a, you know, a 10% cut.

165
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:32.769
Mike Nelson: There were these facilitators, and, you know, the nephew of so-and-so, and they got a 10% of the cut, and yet things worked

166
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.440
Mike Nelson: After a fashion, and they… and things got built, and…

167
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:46.140
Mike Nelson: I mean, New York City, in the worst of the Boss Tweed days, managed to build quite the infrastructure. Now.

168
00:19:46.490 --> 00:20:02.479
Mike Nelson: they had some advantages. There was all this new technology, and there was this flood of immigrants coming in. So even if they were taking 10 or 20%, they had a lot left over to do good things. It was crony capitalism, because it was obviously not

169
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:09.759
Mike Nelson: Being run to the benefit of all, and money was being diverted that could have been spent in much wiser ways.

170
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.230
Mike Nelson: But I think this point of how do we define it is critically important.

171
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:20.530
Mike Nelson: And, and… I love John's idea, which is…

172
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.030
Mike Nelson: You know, the problem is not getting rid of the cronies.

173
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.350
Mike Nelson: The problem is enabling all the rest of us to have some power, too.

174
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:37.800
Mike Nelson: And that's what they thought they were doing in Russia. All these Western economists came in and said, okay, well, we're gonna give

175
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.900
Mike Nelson: All these state enterprises…

176
00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:51.369
Mike Nelson: In the form of shares to Russian citizens. Everybody was gonna have their chunk of this nickel mine and that oil field.

177
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:57.870
Mike Nelson: And somehow it never… Never worked that way. It wasn't decentralized.

178
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.980
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, Mike, it did work that way.

179
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.849
Jerry Michalski: Well, can we just go according to order? Could you put your hand down? Because you spoke a little earlier.

180
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.509
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, sure.

181
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:15.470
Mike Nelson: Well, I would like to hear… if he has a one-sentence intervention, I mean, I think he's right. I mean, the money… the shares were allocated, and then somehow…

182
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.410
Mike Nelson: Somebody went and, you know, reallocated them.

183
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.529
Jerry Michalski: Go ahead, Gil, if you want to… if it's.

184
00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:29.330
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I will, and I'm a little confused, Jerry, because Eric stepped in with a comment before, and that was okay, so I'm not sure what the rule set is on…

185
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.720
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Short comments, but…

186
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.969
Jerry Michalski: Yes. Eric looked like he was trying to explain the thing that happened right then, and I saw him sort of… Yes.

187
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.289
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, that's what I was trying to do.

188
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:38.700
Mike Nelson: Two-finger rule, yeah.

189
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:48.589
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Okay, oh, two fingers? Okay, got it. Two fingers. My understanding, Mike, is that the shares were allocated, and they were very quickly scooped up by the folks that Jerry called that clever name before.

190
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.380
Jerry Michalski: Silver King.

191
00:21:49.820 --> 00:22:06.719
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: the Silova case, so, you know, they went out to the regular people and said, you have these shares that might be worth something someday, but I'm gonna give you a bottle of vodka today. And, like, vom! All of a sudden, all of a sudden, like, in very short order, because there was no protections against that as part of the scheme, the whole thing was consolidated.

192
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.639
Jerry Michalski: You know what they say, a bottle of vodka in the hand is sort of two in the bush.

193
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.440
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There you go.

194
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.259
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: stunningly fast, and I'm sure somebody has unpacked that story, it's a fascinating.

195
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.139
Mike Nelson: I would like to see it, I have not…

196
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:24.389
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There was the potential there for something very, very different than we've ever seen before in the world, and it was just killed, like that.

197
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:30.699
Mike Nelson: Yep, yep, yep. Worker ownership of the entire economy. Okay, thank you very much.

198
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.090
Jerry Michalski: Thank you all.

199
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.490
Alex Kladitis: Okay.

200
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:46.010
Jerry Michalski: Turn the attention for later. One of the things I don't like about Hernando de Soto's, economic theories that we should give people property… we should give very poor people property rights, is that they rapidly get expropriated of those property rights and then have nothing at all.

201
00:22:47.380 --> 00:23:04.239
Jerry Michalski: So, it's weird. How do we protect people and ownership? How do we keep distributed ownership distributed? That's a really interesting question. If it's about a certificate or money, then it's purchasable from you, and then you're done. You don't get that participation anymore, so…

202
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:09.099
Jerry Michalski: Maybe we come back to that a little bit. I want to go to Stacy, who's been really patient, and actually…

203
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:17.549
Jerry Michalski: Alex, I think, was in line earlier and fell out, so let's… I was, and I was waiting, but my hand went down for some reason, so… I think… Can I come in now?

204
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:24.999
Jerry Michalski: I think if we make a little bit of noise on our mics, sometimes the hand automatically goes down, because it thinks we're speaking. So let's do Alex, then Stacey.

205
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.059
Alex Kladitis: Right, thank you. First of all, on the Russia thing.

206
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:36.920
Alex Kladitis: I have heard quite a bit about it. One of the elements was actually, as you say, the stuff was given to the people.

207
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:42.530
Alex Kladitis: But there were a lot of people who didn't have one idea from another what the hell they were given.

208
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:48.430
Alex Kladitis: And there was a lot of mob rule, and they literally went and…

209
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:58.560
Alex Kladitis: they would go to the old people, primarily, and say, you either sign over these things to us, or you die, and generally, they killed them anyway.

210
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.410
Alex Kladitis: The number was hundreds of thousands to millions of people were extorted

211
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:16.010
Alex Kladitis: and a lot of them killed, literally, by the mobs. It was just a whole mob rule type situation. There's a whole load of work being done on that. Anyway, not now. Right, so on this issue.

212
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:31.240
Alex Kladitis: Yes, we're right to be separating crony… sorry, we're saying crony capitalism because our system is capitalist. But actually, I believe cronyism is… is independent of any political system. One's a political system, one's a system of self-interest.

213
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.419
Alex Kladitis: Now, the… the only way I think, and I'm not…

214
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.479
Alex Kladitis: I'll say it, but I know it's impractical at the moment.

215
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:45.610
Alex Kladitis: is… The power that the crony… Cronism has.

216
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:52.960
Alex Kladitis: Is… most of the time, is it secrecy, or by the time it comes out, a lot of time has gone past?

217
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.609
Alex Kladitis: So, one of the things you should do is, to me, force the government and everyone

218
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:12.869
Alex Kladitis: to actually… if you have a chat with a government minister, you produce a document that says, within hours, this is what we spoke about, this is the recording, this is what we said. So, ultimate transparency is what will

219
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:21.270
Alex Kladitis: At least make people aware that something's in the offing, because a lot of it is hidden behind the scenes, nobody ever hears about it, or if they do, it's too late.

220
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.070
Alex Kladitis: Now.

221
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.739
Alex Kladitis: The things that come out against it, those guys will come up and say, one is commercial confidentiality.

222
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:34.489
Alex Kladitis: Personally, I think chronic capitalism has become such a problem that that is irrelevant to me anymore.

223
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:50.959
Alex Kladitis: they use commercial confidentiality for anything. They'll have a great big chat about how they're gonna divvy up, scratch each other's back, or whatever, and they'll put one number, one dollar a month, and say, that's commercial confidentiality. It isn't, but that's how they use it. The other one is, oh, it's…

224
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.710
Alex Kladitis: Secret Service stuff, you cannot say anything. My ultimate thing would be…

225
00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.920
Alex Kladitis: If everybody's… every penny they make, It's up on a blockchain.

226
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.869
Alex Kladitis: For anyone to look at and question, why did you make that amount of money?

227
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.550
Alex Kladitis: It's not comfortable.

228
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:19.090
Alex Kladitis: But at least we'd have a hell of a lot of information, and be able to say, why did this guy get this contract and made a few million out of the side there, when the contract had nothing to do with it?

229
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.390
Alex Kladitis: So, it's… is it practical? Could it ever happen?

230
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.270
Alex Kladitis: I don't know, because these guys are pretty good at covering the tracks Under the name of secrecy.

231
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.499
Alex Kladitis: So, but the blockchain couldn't give you a lot of transparency.

232
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:41.899
Alex Kladitis: Even if you don't go down the commercial route, if every government, senator, whatever, minister, every officer, every time you spoke to someone.

233
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:46.949
Alex Kladitis: You had to say what you spoke about, and here's the recording or the notes of it.

234
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.379
Alex Kladitis: Out in the open. Within seconds.

235
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.430
Alex Kladitis: Then, I think, a lot less would happen.

236
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.470
Alex Kladitis: But… Who am I to say that?

237
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.349
Alex Kladitis: I don't think it'll happen.

238
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:18.610
Jerry Michalski: A couple items there. The government of Estonia, when they got their country back, went all electronic. They were like, screw paper, and we're gonna just go electronic, and they did a bunch of very innovative things. They had a platform for a while, I didn't have time right now to check whether it's still active and going, but called X-Road.

239
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.100
Jerry Michalski: Slash Road.

240
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:34.739
Jerry Michalski: Which, they were actually starting to sell to other countries as a platform for government. And I think, I think, I'd love to fact-check this, I think when they started, every elected official had to post their calendar online.

241
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:51.059
Jerry Michalski: And then my friend, Andrew Roche was trying to run for elected office in Manhattan years ago, and he and Mikha Sifri were trying to get… one of their agenda items was, we just want people to post their calendars. We want elected officials to post who they're meeting with.

242
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.989
Jerry Michalski: That's it. Who they're meet… and could not get that through.

243
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:04.159
Jerry Michalski: could not get open calendaring through as a small issue in an election cycle, blah blah blah blah, because

244
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.550
Jerry Michalski: You know, who you meet with is one of the things. When…

245
00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.780
Jerry Michalski: Oh, God, not Scalia. When,

246
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:19.440
Jerry Michalski: Clarence Thomas was being, was being, outed for receiving a lot of gifts and things like that.

247
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.060
Jerry Michalski: He was going to these retreats.

248
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:36.290
Jerry Michalski: the retreats, it's not the money that matters in the fancy jet, it's the fact that those are places where people get to corner you and have conversations with you. It's the conversations that matter, not so much the money and the other goodies.

249
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.099
Jerry Michalski: So all these things are, are…

250
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:55.489
Jerry Michalski: it's possible to legislate, it's just that you can't get people to do it. Now, it could be that humans in America and other countries are really ready for a radically more transparent government, and that that would be part of a platform offer for a new party coming in. I would like that.

251
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.280
Jerry Michalski: I think that'd be really pretty cool.

252
00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.660
Jerry Michalski: We're gonna get rid of this kind of stuff and do it in this other kind of way.

253
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.169
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, thank you for your patience.

254
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.800
Jerry Michalski: The floor is yours.

255
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.740
Stacey Druss: I wanted to go back and speak to the human part of the question.

256
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:15.210
Stacey Druss: from the small and local. So…

257
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:28.520
Stacey Druss: When we go to our friends, it's usually because we're looking for a bargain. When I became president of a condo association, we had a rule in place that if you lived in the building, you couldn't do work in the building.

258
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:41.450
Stacey Druss: Well, we had a contractor living in our building who became my vice president, and I changed that role. He was allowed to do the work in the building, but we got the family discount, and we showed

259
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:48.779
Stacey Druss: All of his… all of the materials that he bought, we got his contractor's discount. We showed that.

260
00:29:48.910 --> 00:30:08.340
Stacey Druss: the people in the building already trusted me. I had given them a lot of reason to trust me. Everything was there. We saved a lot of money by using him, and he got the benefit of getting the work. It was his home. It was our home. There was, a mental thing going on where we all belonged

261
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.359
Stacey Druss: to the community. When I look at what's happening in New York City.

262
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:32.600
Stacey Druss: and I'm involved in discussions with Mondami, and I have people saying all these horrible things, and, you know, this is socialism, blah blah blah, and I point out to them that this man has 90,000 community members working together, and they will bring up theft, and I say, well.

263
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:45.380
Stacey Druss: when… I mean, this sounds kind of silly, but when you feel like something belongs to you and your community, even if you're going to steal, you usually steal from outside your community.

264
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.750
Stacey Druss: There's… there's just…

265
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.419
Stacey Druss: there's a lot of human nature that I do think needs to be considered.

266
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.330
Stacey Druss: And,

267
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:16.890
Stacey Druss: I just want to say that I've had many conversations with many people, and there's only two sectors. One would be the entertainment industry, and the other would be in, like, finance, where repeatedly, good people have said things that go like this.

268
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:23.970
Stacey Druss: Well, you gotta work with bad people if you're gonna make it in this business. And I always want to throw up.

269
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:33.929
Stacey Druss: Now, it used to be that you didn't hear that in government, and that was because they were afraid they'd be outed.

270
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:49.349
Stacey Druss: People held secrets over you. Now it doesn't matter. Secrets don't matter. There is no shame. You don't have to worry about being outed, because it's fake news. It doesn't matter. Nobody believes anything.

271
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:57.019
Stacey Druss: So, I think transparency has to be a big part of everything, but I also think, like, when…

272
00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:03.160
Stacey Druss: Oh, John is still here. When John was talking, I always think of the jury system.

273
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:11.730
Stacey Druss: And I like the idea of juries, but I wish they were juries in other locations, where they have no ties at all.

274
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.190
Stacey Druss: You know, I think that kind of…

275
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:33.299
Stacey Druss: disconnect, but connect, could be, like, a good thing. I don't know if that makes any sense, but I… I think that, by nature, we want to be surrounded around people we want to be surrounded by, and that part's a good thing, which is…

276
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:43.640
Stacey Druss: Why we give business to those around us, but when it becomes bad is when it's us against them, and there is no

277
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.479
Stacey Druss: Diversity, equity, and inclusion.

278
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.820
Stacey Druss: Over.

279
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.749
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Stacy.

280
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:58.200
Jerry Michalski: Conflicts of interest, all those kinds of things are really hard to untangle and get right.

281
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.669
Jerry Michalski: And it's… it's part of… it's part of…

282
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:10.679
Jerry Michalski: how we construct society in different ways, right? And different societies have different things. Gil asked earlier in the chat, why only Estonia? Estonia had this weird moment, Gil.

283
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:23.140
Jerry Michalski: Where… where they just had a chance to reinvent things. Iceland had a moment where they reinvented their constitution, and then the Parliament failed to ratify it. So they did a great, great job.

284
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:27.760
Jerry Michalski: Rethinking a very old Danish constitution that they inherited that they didn't like.

285
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:33.189
Jerry Michalski: And then, it didn't make… it didn't survive the political process, which is, to my mind.

286
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:38.720
Jerry Michalski: stupid. I mean, if you've done some great work that's unifying people, like, go for it.

287
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:46.809
Alex Kladitis: Well, that's the reason, Jerry, sorry, yeah, Gerry, because the crony capitalists, or one of the cronyists.

288
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:52.149
Alex Kladitis: got to them, because they didn't want that to go through, in both cases.

289
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.530
Jerry Michalski: Yep.

290
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:06.350
Jerry Michalski: Eric posts in the chat that Denmark is seen as one of the lowest perceived public sector corruption… corrupt companies… countries… company, that's very funny.

291
00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:16.050
Jerry Michalski: And here are some reasons. There's, eric, are you familiar with the folk school system in Northern Europe? The Folkschorn?

292
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:17.909
Jerry Michalski: forkscolon.

293
00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:29.480
Jerry Michalski: Back in… I'll look it up, but there was a system of schools, and it turns out that in most Nordic countries, a third of the population went to these schools.

294
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:44.009
Jerry Michalski: And these schools were really, really good about civic participation, that they kind of turned out really good citizens. And it's possible that the governments we have now in Northern European social democracies

295
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:51.079
Jerry Michalski: are good and less corrupt and more trusted by their citizens because of things like that. I don't know.

296
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.840
Jerry Michalski: flinging around theories here. Alex, please.

297
00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.669
Alex Kladitis: I… Sorry, can I just say, comment on that, Eric's, ChatGPT point?

298
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:15.969
Alex Kladitis: Okay, so the way it's phrased is lowest amount of perceived public sector corruption in the world. Let's assume it's not ChatGPT making it misnoming, or whatever, mis texting or whatever, but

299
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:28.900
Alex Kladitis: if everybody else is 100%, where is Denmark? Because it says… so, first it says it's lowest perceived, and then why is Denmark scene so clean? Well, I don't think you can infer one from the other, because

300
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:41.129
Alex Kladitis: if everybody's at 100% cronyism, and Denmark is at 95, there's still cronyism. So, what is the qualitative or quantitative element of that statement?

301
00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:49.459
Alex Kladitis: And that's… that's what we're talking about. We're not talking about who's the lowest, or who's better than… we can talk about who's better than the others.

302
00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.490
Alex Kladitis: But the fact is, cronyism

303
00:35:51.590 --> 00:36:08.069
Alex Kladitis: is there, no matter what the society. And I would… I would say, not just Denmark, looking at the way the Western governments, Western European governments are behaving at the moment, I don't think there's any of them that's clean, in any way, shape, or form, including Denmark, given how the position's taking at the moment in politics.

304
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.199
Alex Kladitis: just the way I'm looking at it. Sorry.

305
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:20.819
Mike Nelson: And… and I think… The other thing we want to know is how are those numbers changing?

306
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.939
Mike Nelson: I mean, are there countries that are getting better, or is everybody going downhill?

307
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.419
Mike Nelson: Into the cesspool of the swamp.

308
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.460
Alex Kladitis: Yep.

309
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:40.609
Jerry Michalski: Eric had posted some useful links earlier about Transparency International and a couple other organizations, and I think that the transparency,

310
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.830
Jerry Michalski: info about

311
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:50.380
Jerry Michalski: You know, the surveys of global transparency are still pretty credible and pretty good and useful guides.

312
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.289
Jerry Michalski: And you were about to jump in and say something, Eric, go ahead.

313
00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:00.739
Erik Willekens: Yeah, I wanted… I didn't find a hand gesture symbol anywhere anymore. It's alright.

314
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.690
Jerry Michalski: Go to the heart if you're on a Mac.

315
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.290
Erik Willekens: Okay. So,

316
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:12.929
Erik Willekens: Indeed, those, I just want to say a bit of the whole picture that I sent in those few links, because it's just links.

317
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:33.940
Erik Willekens: So one part of it is Global Action Networks. That's a guy, Steve Wardell, he wrote about it, and he basically… his principle is you have to work with all different actors from the different worlds to solve a problem internationally. He gives the example of the diamond trade, where in order for the…

318
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:48.330
Erik Willekens: for the… it's like a slave trade, most of the history, and they started cooperating with the ones that sell diamonds in Antwerp, for instance, the… there's a big diamond sector, to then

319
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:57.509
Erik Willekens: creates… What is it, like, that, like… I don't find a word.

320
00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.649
Mike Nelson: The trust mark.

321
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.220
Erik Willekens: Thanks.

322
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:03.220
Erik Willekens: Yeah, a trust mark, there's another word for it, but let's say a trust mark

323
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:24.280
Erik Willekens: And any diamond mine then can get it, that is not working with slaves anymore. And then they have to also decide, do we work then? How do we change those other that are still working with slaves? So they start… have to also start working with the ones that are still working with slave trade. So there's this in-between place as well.

324
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:31.380
Erik Willekens: I think Denmark is perceived as one of the better ones. It's still not free from corruption, but it's… it's a place to look at

325
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.339
Erik Willekens: And by,

326
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:42.310
Erik Willekens: what Transparency International does is it's looking all over the world, it's using indicators to see, like, who's…

327
00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:48.130
Erik Willekens: who's… Doing what on which of the aspects of

328
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:55.080
Erik Willekens: Of transparency, what's in order, what's not, and they're… they're updating yearly a list of

329
00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:10.799
Erik Willekens: are these, countries behaving in a transparent way or not? And then there's another one, which is circularized. They actually, in the whole value chain, it's very sensitive to share information, because once you're going to say,

330
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.709
Erik Willekens: Once you're sharing information about any part of your value chain that is not

331
00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:23.980
Erik Willekens: paving according to ethical values. That's also not good on your shareholders, and it will create an immediate backlash on your

332
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:32.859
Erik Willekens: Well… on… on your… On your economy, on your business. So they do it

333
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.999
Erik Willekens: In a way that's secure, that's private.

334
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:52.369
Erik Willekens: So all the info… it becomes a way to show what's in a value system, what's ethical and what's not, to then be able to talk about it, because otherwise it keeps on being secretive, nobody shares it, so that's kind of a smart way to tackle that problem.

335
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.969
Erik Willekens: Is to look into the…

336
00:39:54.070 --> 00:40:01.449
Erik Willekens: Like, it's a closed system where the people who are involved can actually start looking at the value chain and how to improve it.

337
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:13.780
Erik Willekens: I think that makes much more sense than just say, show every penny. That's… idealistically, that sounds good, but it's not practical at all. It's really not a realistic way in… for companies to evolve.

338
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.440
Erik Willekens: Oh, and that's also this point about the slave trade, like.

339
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:32.619
Erik Willekens: you have to start talking to the people who don't do it well to be able to change them, and work with the enemy, work with the bad guys to make them less bad guys. That's a principle we don't like. We don't like to make our hands dirty as idealists.

340
00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:40.870
Erik Willekens: there's this other guy, Kahani, who says, like, yeah, there is power and heart, and they need to come together. Love and power.

341
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:45.740
Erik Willekens: You also need to be able to… Yeah, if you… if you're…

342
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:51.350
Erik Willekens: Wanting to deal with power and how to change it, you'll have to go into the places where it hurts.

343
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.310
Erik Willekens: That's another part.

344
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:59.459
Erik Willekens: there's more aspects, but that's what my mental alacrity allows for the moment. Thank you.

345
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.960
Jerry Michalski: I think you mean Adam Kahane, and…

346
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.660
Erik Willekens: Yes.

347
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.229
Jerry Michalski: And his book is Power and Love, A Theory and Practice of Social Change.

348
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:19.169
Erik Willekens: Yeah, and what they… yeah, and their… their consultancy agency, so both Steve Odell and Adam Kahnig are… have been in the same consultancy agency, I don't remember…

349
00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.479
Erik Willekens: Rios partners.

350
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.410
Jerry Michalski: It's Rios Partners, which is now owned by Generon.

351
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:34.350
Erik Willekens: Yeah, well, probably Rios Partners also did some evil things, but they also have a lot of really deep multi-stakeholder processes that did make sense, and that did change things.

352
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.059
Erik Willekens: Adam Karani was involved also in the process of

353
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:42.089
Erik Willekens: of South Africa when they… yeah.

354
00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:51.290
Erik Willekens: when they changed from an apartheid regime, which is kind of still there, but it's also kind of better. I mean, everything is gradual, I think, and changes when…

355
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.960
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, thank you for bringing all those things into our conversation. Really appreciate it, Eric.

356
00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.629
Jerry Michalski: Alex, please.

357
00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:05.529
Alex Kladitis: Thank you, Eric. Very interesting. The thought that came to my mind is that

358
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:12.269
Alex Kladitis: What you're describing is excellent, is happening, is changing the…

359
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:22.949
Alex Kladitis: let's put it… the influence part of crony capitalism, or cronyism, the influence part, because there's influence, but there's also criminality.

360
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:30.659
Alex Kladitis: And everything you described there, to me, helps with the influence part, and by no means, that's a great thing to do.

361
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.410
Alex Kladitis: But I would like to… what came to my mind is, yeah, that addresses the influence part.

362
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:41.050
Alex Kladitis: But the criminality is a big issue. There are criminals out there doing… making things happen.

363
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:47.360
Alex Kladitis: Right? And it influences politics, it influences policy and everything else. It's not just the…

364
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.449
Alex Kladitis: The… the elective… what are we gonna call it?

365
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.609
Alex Kladitis: the normal things.

366
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:58.290
Alex Kladitis: non-criminal things. There is criminalism in crony capitalism, so if you go to Russia.

367
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.069
Alex Kladitis: This criminalism there, in addition to crony capitalism.

368
00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:10.830
Alex Kladitis: I would argue there's criminalism everywhere, but it's a bit easier to see it in Russia than it is to see it in the US, or Britain, or whatever it is that we are.

369
00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.680
Alex Kladitis: You know, it's sort of…

370
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:24.290
Alex Kladitis: I could tell you things about corruption, but anyway, never mind. That's the point I was trying to make, is that there's probably more nuance, but I liked what you said, Eric, because it addresses the…

371
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:29.200
Alex Kladitis: The normal, safe, Version of cronyism.

372
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.160
Jerry Michalski: just to add, to build on what you're saying, Alex, there's also,

373
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:49.659
Jerry Michalski: A trend to legalize a lot of things that you would see as immoral or crony or whatever else, just by passing laws because you have enough power, that things that you would normally not have allowed to have happen are suddenly not illegal anymore.

374
00:43:49.850 --> 00:44:03.400
Jerry Michalski: They're just not things you want to see happening. But that happens in regime after regime. Once you get capture, once you get regulatory capture, you can effectively, sort of whitewash what you're doing a lot.

375
00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.870
Jerry Michalski: Eric, it looked like you were gonna… Jump in again?

376
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:18.209
Erik Willekens: Yeah, I'm still… I can't find this hand symbol still, but I'm the, not the one that puts up my hand, actually. Yeah. So…

377
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.610
Erik Willekens: Yeah, I just want to give it an example, like…

378
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:28.650
Erik Willekens: I live in The Hague. The Hague has the International Criminal Court and the Criminal Court of Justice.

379
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.449
Erik Willekens: The big problem is, like, on an international level, it's very difficult

380
00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:40.080
Erik Willekens: for law to be effect, like, Netanyahu has been,

381
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:48.470
Erik Willekens: on the list of, like, you have to, like, bring him over to the International Criminal Court of Justice.

382
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.290
Erik Willekens: If he passes in your country, that doesn't happen.

383
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:56.310
Erik Willekens: But… and that's… that shows, like, how difficult it is for an international community.

384
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:05.259
Erik Willekens: to actually live according to laws on an international level. It does work a bit, but it also shows within how, like, how…

385
00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:16.380
Erik Willekens: Our countries, they seem to be better because we're democracies, but then when push comes to shove, we actually also become a bit crony, even on that level.

386
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:26.519
Erik Willekens: And we are… I mean, The Hague for me is very hopeful in one way, because they actually do that. They actually put them up as a criminal. On the other hand.

387
00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:44.580
Erik Willekens: I'm also very close to Rotterdam, which is one of the biggest drug trafficking hubs in the whole world, which is irony, like, it's everywhere, and it's kind of… and the Shell headquarters, like, right around the corner, so it's… it's all happening together so close to each other, which is kind of crazy.

388
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:56.319
Erik Willekens: this kind of lawfulness, lawlessness. It's… it's happening in the same place, at the same time, like, 500 meters from each other, and it's the absolute opposite.

389
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:02.870
Jerry Michalski: I mean, this is,

390
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:15.330
Jerry Michalski: This opens up so many interesting questions, because what you were just saying made me realize that I have a thought in my brain, Trump and Putin are acid tests of the world's legal systems.

391
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:25.150
Jerry Michalski: That, you know, if the legal systems can't stop people, and that's supposed to be the recourse within the system.

392
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.879
Jerry Michalski: Then what… what does?

393
00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:28.699
Mike Nelson: Who said that?

394
00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:30.720
Jerry Michalski: Pardon?

395
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.970
Mike Nelson: Who said that quote?

396
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:38.139
Jerry Michalski: That was me. That was just the way… that was a label I gave a thought in my brain, which I'll post into the chat now.

397
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.849
Mike Nelson: That's very wise. Very good. Very quotable and tweetable.

398
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.330
Jerry Michalski: Oh, good. Doug, you're muted, go ahead.

399
00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.230
Doug Breitbart: Yeah, I just,

400
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.800
Doug Breitbart: I think there's a tendency to conflate legal system

401
00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:00.670
Doug Breitbart: With a set of morality, ethics, and values.

402
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.220
Doug Breitbart: And they are not an equivalency.

403
00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:19.410
Doug Breitbart: a legal system… If you look at the definition of… of law, it is a system…

404
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:26.160
Doug Breitbart: For… by which a… Society or state or other

405
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:31.459
Doug Breitbart: Defines a set of rules that apply to all

406
00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:37.349
Doug Breitbart: And that defines the penalty when broken, breached, or violated.

407
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:43.839
Doug Breitbart: So the emphasis of… definitionally, the emphasis of law… what a law is.

408
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:52.499
Doug Breitbart: And what a legal system is, is it's a system that defines a set of rules and defines a set of penalties for violating them.

409
00:47:54.450 --> 00:48:03.950
Doug Breitbart: There is no intrinsic thing that says a legal system has to be moral, ethical, fair, or righteous.

410
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:10.390
Doug Breitbart: So… to your statement, Jerry, I don't think…

411
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:18.210
Doug Breitbart: Trump and Putin test legal systems. Trump and Putin are just varieties of legal systems.

412
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:23.619
Doug Breitbart: They just happen to be totalitarian.

413
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.140
Doug Breitbart: authoritarian.

414
00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:30.380
Doug Breitbart: Their law governs, and everybody else marches to the order or gets shot.

415
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:35.180
Doug Breitbart: The common law legal system, the…

416
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.970
Doug Breitbart: In, you know, quaint old institutions, legal institutional structures of

417
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.439
Doug Breitbart: you know, what used to be the United States of America.

418
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:54.630
Doug Breitbart: Purports to carry and bring values and service-tos and all sorts of plugins and add-ons and layers.

419
00:48:54.790 --> 00:49:04.509
Doug Breitbart: But that's not… strictly, about the legal system. It's about, you know, in whose hand it's being wielded.

420
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.570
Doug Breitbart: And with that, I'm complete.

421
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.819
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Doug.

422
00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:26.980
Jerry Michalski: Partly what I meant was, when Trump was out of power in his interregnum, you know, post his first administration, he did not control any of the mechanisms of power. He had referent… he had amazing referent power within the Republican Party.

423
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.090
Jerry Michalski: That played out like crazy, played out just right for him.

424
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.279
Jerry Michalski: But

425
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:45.940
Jerry Michalski: there was a legal system that he did not control with a bunch of Trump-appointed judges who were ruling against him, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So I'm… Putin less so, because once Putin took control, he managed to, you know, weaken everything.

426
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.459
Jerry Michalski: And, and break institutions, a lot.

427
00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.680
Jerry Michalski: And put his cronies in charge.

428
00:49:55.180 --> 00:50:02.830
Jerry Michalski: But I'm… I'm between what Eric just said about the International Criminal Court, which I'm, you know, slightly aware of, how…

429
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:21.919
Jerry Michalski: how difficult and futile the work of actually bringing people to justice is worldwide. Worldwide. I think I mentioned here, Mark Goodman is a consultant on crime. He used to work at FBI, then he worked at Interpol, and he gave a talk at the Institute for the Future years ago, where he described how to communicate with one of his peers across the Atlantic.

430
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:30.929
Jerry Michalski: He had to go through channels, his message had to sort of work its way up, go across, work its way down, and then he said, and our enemies are just using email.

431
00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:41.169
Jerry Michalski: They're just writing to each other, or signal, or whatever. I mean, like, you know, encrypted messaging, right? I don't we just write each other? And you could hear an audible gasp go through the audience.

432
00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:42.100
Doug Breitbart: Everybody's like.

433
00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:57.250
Jerry Michalski: wow, we're… we're really screwed. Like, if we're forcing… if we're forcing enforcers to go through channels and, you know, hindering their every effort to do stuff, wow! And, by the way, it's real easy to pass laws that cripple

434
00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:13.540
Jerry Michalski: efforts to corral bad actors. And when bad actors get in… when you get capture, how do you avoid… I think… I think maybe this is one of my particular fascinations with this question about crony capitalism is, how do you detect, avoid, and then undo capture of systems?

435
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:14.720
Mike Nelson: Hmm.

436
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.410
Jerry Michalski: Gil, please.

437
00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:33.779
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, I think that's a really important question, Jerry. The anti-corruption mechanisms that we've put in place over the decades came from good intent, but they get ossified.

438
00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:43.959
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: When I was CSO of Palo Alto, I couldn't talk to city council members outside of council meetings unless I had the explicit approval of the city manager.

439
00:51:44.410 --> 00:52:01.529
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yep. And no more than two of them could talk together. If three of them talk together, it's a violation of some state law. So, you know, there's good intention and then difficult mechanisms and regulatory capture and all that, but I want to follow on what Doug said. I think what he said about laws.

440
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:10.350
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: is extremely important. it, it, it raises the parallel system that we have in human cultures of norms.

441
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:23.099
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And shaming as, as adjustment and control mechanisms, which of course have their own downside, because they can suppress variety and deviation and individual freedom and so forth.

442
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:36.419
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But the question I've been mulling as I've been driving is this, is that, I think we may have talked about this last week or the week before. When a lion brings down a gazelle.

443
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.590
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: kills it, drags it back to its pride to eat. Is that crime?

444
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:53.849
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Predation is part of the living world. Things eat other things, things kill other things. We have parasites. These are evolutionary processes that are adaptive.

445
00:52:53.850 --> 00:53:05.690
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: In certain ways, and they're constrained in certain ways, and is what we're talking about just that? An organism or an entity striving for advantage and benefit, which all organisms do.

446
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:12.799
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And there are various countervailing forces, you know, biological in the case of the non-human living world.

447
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:23.220
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Institutional and cultural in the case of the human living world. And this is a constant dance of coevolution, and any thought of ever ending it is folly.

448
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:28.809
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And the question is, what dance moves do we make to have the dance be something that we like?

449
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:34.400
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I'm complete with that question, and… actually, I'm not complete. I'm in the thrall of that question.

450
00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.280
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Let's see where y'all go with it.

451
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.080
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Gil.

452
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:40.200
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Thank you.

453
00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.559
Jerry Michalski: Where do we go? Why don't we go into silence for a moment? This… we've gone…

454
00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:59.819
Jerry Michalski: very quickly through a lot of things, and we keep dragging large issues onto the conversation, which I… which I love, but I find a little overwhelming now and then. So let me go into silence, and I'll bring us back out in a little moment.

455
00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:02.359
Jerry Michalski: Everybody take… Three long breaths.

456
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.430
Jerry Michalski: Just… Inhale, gently.

457
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.520
Jerry Michalski: Hold the breath at the top a tiny bit.

458
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.589
Jerry Michalski: Let it all out.

459
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.430
Jerry Michalski: Stop at the bottom for a little bit.

460
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.950
Jerry Michalski: Inhale again.

461
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.040
Jerry Michalski: Take it in.

462
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.980
Jerry Michalski: Hold it at the top.

463
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:24.389
Jerry Michalski: Let it out.

464
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.979
Jerry Michalski: Hold it at the bottom.

465
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.380
Jerry Michalski: One more. Inhale.

466
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.129
Jerry Michalski: Fill your lungs.

467
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:36.020
Jerry Michalski: Hold it.

468
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:43.790
Jerry Michalski: And then let it up, and let… Whatever was troubling you, go.

469
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.259
Jerry Michalski: with the air.

470
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.900
Jerry Michalski: Also, a public service announcement, which I will make

471
00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.120
Jerry Michalski: More often than I do, which is never…

472
00:55:53.730 --> 00:56:00.469
Jerry Michalski: I do post these recordings to YouTube, like, right away, so what we say in here does go openly into the world.

473
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:05.380
Jerry Michalski: Just so everybody knows the ground rules here. I don't… I don't…

474
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:11.460
Jerry Michalski: I don't have a preamble, there isn't a place where, you know, all those kinds of things are stated very often, so…

475
00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:13.629
Jerry Michalski: I think it's useful to note that.

476
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:19.979
Mike Nelson: How many people watch a typical episode, and have you had any episodes get thousands of viewers?

477
00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.849
Jerry Michalski: Oh, our viewership is massive. We get, like…

478
00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:24.549
Doug Breitbart: 15 to 30.

479
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:29.899
Jerry Michalski: viewerships for some of the most popular episodes. I mean, we really, we're really going.

480
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.240
Mike Nelson: I just wanted to make that clear to people.

481
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:38.430
Jerry Michalski: And none of our episodes… none of our calls has gone viral that I know of, anyway.

482
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:40.079
Mike Nelson: Can I, can I ask…

483
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:51.099
Alex Kladitis: Can I ask the question, what makes a person, out of all the YouTube material, what makes a person specifically look for our recording?

484
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:52.030
Alex Kladitis: Wow, baby.

485
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:54.809
Mike Nelson: They missed it, and they heard it was good.

486
00:56:55.160 --> 00:57:03.000
Jerry Michalski: I think there… I think there are people who have discovered our conversations unlike them. I know that one of my dojo mates, regularly, you know.

487
00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:10.659
Jerry Michalski: browses our calls and will comment to me on the map about things we said, and it's like, oh, so-and-so did this and that. I'm like, oh, wow, dang.

488
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.790
Jerry Michalski: So I, you know, I think there are people who, enjoy.

489
00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.580
Jerry Michalski: what it is we're doing, somehow. I like that. Eric, you were trying to say something a moment ago.

490
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:28.990
Erik Willekens: Yeah, there's… Yeah, how long did it take for a bug to get recognized? A scoundrel.

491
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.450
Erik Willekens: And,

492
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:41.259
Erik Willekens: he was a scoundrel, a bit. He was not an easy person. But on the other hand, I shared this thing about embracing the groundless… groundless ground, and this was a very deep…

493
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:49.640
Erik Willekens: exist… existential philosophical conversation I had with… and it's this artifact generated and clawed on

494
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.239
Erik Willekens: Hard to be with the fact that there is no…

495
00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:59.900
Erik Willekens: no easy fundament of positivity to hold onto in life. There's always gonna be more negativity.

496
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.250
Erik Willekens: And that came up when you had this moment of silence.

497
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:08.630
Erik Willekens: So, I just wanted to hand… yeah, add that, like, we… we are…

498
00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.670
Erik Willekens: We're living in a world with a groundless ground.

499
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:13.880
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Eric.

500
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.150
Jerry Michalski: Pete, you gotta follow that.

501
00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:26.410
Pete Kaminski: I cannot, improve on that, living in a world with a groundless ground.

502
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:33.510
Pete Kaminski: I wanted to come back to the YouTube viewership, YouTube channel viewership, and it's…

503
00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:47.069
Pete Kaminski: It's… it's true that in the vast world of billions of people, there are going to be a dozen or two who see this recording.

504
00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:54.110
Pete Kaminski: But I also wanted to point out, and I don't mean to scare anybody or anything like that, but I also want to point out that

505
00:58:54.210 --> 00:59:07.689
Pete Kaminski: not counted in those views are the transcript getting offloaded to Gemini, and if Anthropic and OpenAR are clever, they'll also end up with that transcript.

506
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:21.900
Pete Kaminski: And then social network analysis will, keep the set of these people, talking about these topics, and you said this thing in… in public, basically, forever.

507
00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:32.669
Pete Kaminski: So it's, it's an… I, I, I appreciate, Jerry, that you post these, these calls, in public,

508
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:44.889
Pete Kaminski: And I wanted to just make it clear that, counting YouTube viewers is not the, not the only ramification of where… where this ends up.

509
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.570
Jerry Michalski: Absolutely.

510
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.169
Doug Breitbart: Absolutely, thank you. Especially in the times we're living in.

511
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:51.990
Alex Kladitis: Yeah.

512
00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:57.420
Alex Kladitis: I have to say, Gerry, that you're absolutely right, because

513
00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:10.840
Alex Kladitis: you cannot imagine how uncomfortable it makes me when I finish a call, and then I say, I think, oh, I said this, and I was gone to the world, you know? It's like… because when I'm in the moment, I'm talking to you guys, I'm not talking to the world.

514
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:17.239
Alex Kladitis: if I was a politician, I'd be talking to the world, so I wouldn't say half the things I say. It's a bit of a…

515
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:18.870
Alex Kladitis: you know.

516
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:26.140
Alex Kladitis: It makes me deeply uncomfortable, personally. If I could find the same audience, but without the transmission to the world, I'd be a lot more comfortable.

517
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:27.759
Jerry Michalski: Totally get that.

518
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:47.610
Jerry Michalski: In, in days of old, when I got out of grad school, before I started my first job out of grad school, I had a brief consulting engagement in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for 7 weeks. So I went there and did some really cool work, and made some friends who told me stories about the dirty war, and

519
01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:02.090
Jerry Michalski: the stories would go roughly like, you know, you'd be in a cafe with your buddies, and all of a sudden, somebody would say, hey, the federal police is here, and everybody would just, like, leap out the windows and race to get out of there. Like, you did not want to be corralled.

520
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:11.159
Jerry Michalski: And then, if they sort of caught people, they'd go to your home, they didn't necessarily need a search warrant and things like that, they'd go to your home, or they'd just pick up your address book.

521
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:33.749
Jerry Michalski: And they would ransack your home, and if there was anything lefty in your home, and the best musicians of that era are… joined the Communist Party as protest, and then were basically forced to emigrate out of Argentina and Chile and Brazil, so a lot of them ended up in France and became really brilliant musicians and came back later to triumph.

522
01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:49.710
Jerry Michalski: But if you had a record by Mercedes Sosa or Caetano Veloso or something like that, you might be disappeared and pushed out of a helicopter over the river plate. That, you know, that was happening. But then they'd grab your… and I'm saying all this because then they'd grab your address book and lather, rinse, repeat.

523
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:58.130
Jerry Michalski: They would basically go through your private contact list in your address book. And our address books are now very, very public.

524
01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:05.539
Jerry Michalski: In ways that are uncomfortable for anybody who thinks that we're heading toward those kinds of regimes.

525
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.709
Jerry Michalski: And that is a piece of modern reality, unfortunately.

526
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:12.530
Jerry Michalski: Doug.

527
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.779
Jerry Michalski: We seek wisdom in these troubling times, Doug. What do you have for us?

528
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:26.079
Doug Breitbart: Well, I was actually… I wanted to respond where you just went, but also to respond to where Alex went.

529
01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:31.960
Doug Breitbart: with that discomfort thing, and I was… and my… my question is, what if…

530
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:43.059
Doug Breitbart: You existed in a space and place in terms of your own identity, your own Earth, your own values, your own consciousness.

531
01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.780
Doug Breitbart: that,

532
01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:53.219
Doug Breitbart: You had no… Self-consciousness fear.

533
01:02:54.020 --> 01:03:00.109
Doug Breitbart: Or doubt attached to how you walked in the world, how you contributed to the world, and…

534
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:01.590
Doug Breitbart: what you said.

535
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.470
Doug Breitbart: what you do.

536
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:12.579
Doug Breitbart: And… I'm having a very rubber-meets-the-road moment around that question.

537
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:19.750
Doug Breitbart: with my partners in being in systems at this moment. So…

538
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:26.910
Doug Breitbart: One of my partners and I found ourselves deciding with a new, relatively new client.

539
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:31.560
Doug Breitbart: To, with a little bit of a pricey.

540
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:36.959
Doug Breitbart: To send a transcript of our last discussion about that client.

541
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:40.250
Doug Breitbart: Unedited.

542
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.040
Doug Breitbart: Unadulterated, unfiltered.

543
01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:53.980
Doug Breitbart: Because both of us, at the end of it, looked at each other and said, There's nothing in there.

544
01:03:54.850 --> 01:04:01.090
Doug Breitbart: That isn't 100% in alignment with our orientation, our values are being in service to.

545
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.550
Doug Breitbart: And…

546
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:11.660
Doug Breitbart: Our difference, because we're being in systems, the focus is on the being part, not on the systems part.

547
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.940
Doug Breitbart: What we're actually selling is exactly that.

548
01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:21.439
Doug Breitbart: It's, you know, what's living for us in response to…

549
01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.999
Doug Breitbart: In… in the moment of the conversation.

550
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.790
Doug Breitbart: And…

551
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:37.589
Doug Breitbart: In the context of the world we live in, in the context of the working world, in the context of the culture we're in.

552
01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:42.909
Doug Breitbart: You know, the rule is nobody tells you your fly is down until after you zip it up.

553
01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.430
Doug Breitbart: Nobody ever says what they're actually thinking. Nobody actually shares what they're feeling.

554
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.679
Doug Breitbart: Because that's dangerous and risky.

555
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:58.470
Doug Breitbart: And… And I'm just sharing this because there is an alternative.

556
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.730
Doug Breitbart: And consistent with that, I also…

557
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:17.699
Doug Breitbart: don't have… don't carry fear in these kinds of spaces. I've been online in Zoom rooms and recorded sessions. Some posted… a lot posted, most posted, a lot… some not.

558
01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:23.429
Doug Breitbart: And… I'll stand by me.

559
01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:32.109
Doug Breitbart: And I'll accept consequences if the world and culture and society I'm living in decides that

560
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.229
Doug Breitbart: it doesn't like me, I'll… I'll live with that too.

561
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.340
Doug Breitbart: So, anyway, I'm complete with that, but it's just… Yeah.

562
01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.189
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Zach.

563
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:49.309
Alex Kladitis: Thank you, thank you for that, Doug.

564
01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.180
Alex Kladitis: there's a difference. When I listen to you.

565
01:05:53.690 --> 01:06:08.780
Alex Kladitis: I hear wisdom. When I listen to me, I hear… I don't hear wisdom, I hear my thoughts. And my thoughts, from experience, my thoughts are not exactly standard. You know, I tend to…

566
01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:17.010
Alex Kladitis: I've talked to a lot of people about it. I talk to left, I talk to right, you know, and, you know, have a lot of non-standard

567
01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:30.360
Alex Kladitis: things. Anyway, but… sorry, Jerry, I was going to talk about that a bit more, but, we haven't… we've gone away from the crony thing, so do we want to go back there? And… so I don't have anything to say on that. I just wasn't going to say anything more.

568
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:37.070
Jerry Michalski: Why don't you, put your thoughts into the room right now, and then we'll take a little temperature reading about where we are on the crony topic.

569
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:42.189
Alex Kladitis: Okay. My, my, thank you, Doug, for that again, I'll say it.

570
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:48.600
Alex Kladitis: My… the back of my mind, the biggest fear is that a lot of the…

571
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:59.050
Alex Kladitis: analysis of what people are saying and what they believe in is being offloaded, ultimately, to AIs, but even before AIs came along, to… to systems.

572
01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:06.040
Alex Kladitis: So my biggest fear is that my name, or your name, or Jerry's name, or whatever, appears in some list.

573
01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:09.550
Alex Kladitis: Because there are keywords that were used.

574
01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:22.269
Alex Kladitis: And then, you know what bureaucracy's like? Systems of bureaucracies and people. They don't know you or me. And then they'll say, oh, okay, here's… I'll press a button there, and here's under surveillance, or whatever.

575
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:26.659
Alex Kladitis: And then before long, something will go wrong. That's what…

576
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:31.330
Alex Kladitis: Worries me more, particularly now, because it's so impersonal and so…

577
01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:36.500
Alex Kladitis: I've, I've, I hadn't told this group, but… Two or three times.

578
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:42.329
Alex Kladitis: Back in 2010 or something, my parents wired me some money.

579
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.309
Alex Kladitis: to Britain, right? From Greece to Britain.

580
01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.859
Alex Kladitis: And… The money was lost.

581
01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:54.620
Alex Kladitis: I would call my bank, no, nothing's happened. I would call their bank, yeah, we sent it.

582
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.140
Alex Kladitis: So, I actually have to…

583
01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:11.179
Alex Kladitis: 4 weeks or something, I went to the bank, I kicked up Merry Hill, because they kept saying, we've got no record of the money arriving, and I was saying to them, but it's Barclays, it was Barclays. Barclays here, Barclays there. They say they sent it. You say not.

584
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:23.770
Alex Kladitis: Anyway, so I really misbehaved in verbal means, and it's the middle of London, it's the international banking, lots of wealthy people around, and you've got Alex.

585
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:30.540
Alex Kladitis: effing and blinding and accusing everybody of stealing his money or whatever. Anyway, so off I went.

586
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.029
Alex Kladitis: really upset.

587
01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:35.619
Alex Kladitis: And literally, a quarter of a mile away, someone tapped me on the shoulder.

588
01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.519
Alex Kladitis: And it was one of the employees.

589
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:45.079
Alex Kladitis: And they said I'll tell you something now, if you tell anybody else.

590
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:47.159
Alex Kladitis: So it's a few years now, so it doesn't matter.

591
01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.640
Alex Kladitis: If you tell anybody else, I will go to jail.

592
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:53.390
Alex Kladitis: But your money's not lost.

593
01:08:53.630 --> 01:09:01.279
Alex Kladitis: It's just that because it was over a certain amount, it's been flagged for analysis by the Secret Services for terrorist purposes.

594
01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:08.640
Alex Kladitis: And he said, the problem is, they've got such a backlog at the moment, it's taking them 3 months to clear the line.

595
01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:11.320
Alex Kladitis: So you will get your money.

596
01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:16.229
Alex Kladitis: But… but just wait 3 months, literally, when they get through the queue.

597
01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.869
Alex Kladitis: Right? True story, I'm not making it up.

598
01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:23.470
Alex Kladitis: And hopefully nobody's gonna go back and jail the person that told me.

599
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:32.159
Alex Kladitis: The advantage he has, or she has, I actually don't remember the face or anything else in such a state. I actually don't remember what they look like.

600
01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:36.750
Alex Kladitis: But, but… and guess what? Next time, It happened again.

601
01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:47.069
Alex Kladitis: So my name must be on some list. Every time everybody sends me money from overseas, bang! Except now they'll clear the queue faster, perhaps. I don't know, who knows? But that's what scares me.

602
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:52.159
Jerry Michalski: Crazy stuff.

603
01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:58.329
Jerry Michalski: Eric, you've found how to raise your hand. First, I want to thank you for that, congratulate you for that.

604
01:09:58.439 --> 01:10:00.049
Jerry Michalski: The general applause.

605
01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:02.139
Jerry Michalski: And then off to you.

606
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:13.640
Erik Willekens: I was talking to, someone work… About what?

607
01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:22.409
Erik Willekens: It's partly what keeps me having trust that it won't go to the extremes in America.

608
01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.310
Erik Willekens: That the biggest chances that

609
01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:32.759
Erik Willekens: Somehow, it will keep on being intact is because there's a very strong, dissident voice still allowed and able.

610
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:40.619
Erik Willekens: And… The moment the, the dictator wins is when the voices of dissent go silent.

611
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:51.470
Erik Willekens: So, I do hear the true story, I mean, it… and I think it's a tension arc, like, there's a balance to be made, but I also want to name that it's… it's really important

612
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:56.189
Erik Willekens: Like, if you're starting to criticize yourself to,

613
01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.160
Erik Willekens: To hold yourself back from speaking truth.

614
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:05.290
Erik Willekens: You're actually also installing a system Of not speaking up.

615
01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:12.609
Erik Willekens: And I'm sorry for what happened to you as well. I mean, it seems to be a very nasty situation to be in.

616
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:27.019
Erik Willekens: And at the same time, maybe thank you, I don't know, for taking the risk of speaking up and being honest, and maybe it's not always the most handy thing to do, but there is something really positive also in it. Maybe that's what I want to say. It's maintaining

617
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:32.359
Erik Willekens: The dissident voices, which… Which makes or breaks.

618
01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:44.719
Erik Willekens: the rule of law and the dictatorship can be installed or not on a permanent level. There's this one country in the Asian country? I don't remember which one exactly.

619
01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:49.639
Erik Willekens: that actually overturned their dictator not that long ago, a few years ago, I think.

620
01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:57.059
Erik Willekens: And that was also because that was a very strong civic sector that kept on being able to speak out loudly the dissident voice.

621
01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.009
Mike Nelson: I think it was Thailand.

622
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:01.880
Jerry Michalski: Yeah.

623
01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.030
Jerry Michalski: Sounds right.

624
01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:10.539
Mike Nelson: And of course, there's the famous example of Marcos in the Philippines, and how people power can make a difference.

625
01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.149
Jerry Michalski: Mike, the floor is yours.

626
01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.880
Mike Nelson: I wanted to bring up the role of religion.

627
01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:20.640
Mike Nelson: And… How that has utterly failed.

628
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:30.169
Mike Nelson: to stop crony capitalism and corruption. I mean, it's really quite extraordinary. Even the Catholic Church and the Church of the Vatican.

629
01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:36.440
Mike Nelson: Just riddled with corruption, and not, you know, not little… $100,000…

630
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:40.529
Mike Nelson: Stolen checks, you know, and we're talking… you know.

631
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.680
Mike Nelson: hundreds of millions, perhaps more. And often it's just because one or two people

632
01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:54.980
Mike Nelson: Win the trust of people who don't really want to deal with all the complexity of moving money.

633
01:12:55.630 --> 01:13:02.950
Mike Nelson: And they know how to move money, and they move it where they want, and often can cover up their tracks for years.

634
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:04.710
Mike Nelson: I mean, the good news is…

635
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:13.960
Mike Nelson: Because we do have electronic records, and we have more and more tools to spot these anomalous transactions.

636
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.940
Mike Nelson: People are usually caught.

637
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:21.370
Mike Nelson: But it is, it is extraordinary that,

638
01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:27.850
Mike Nelson: all this business about the Ten Commandments, and thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lie.

639
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:37.099
Mike Nelson: it doesn't seem to affect people. Maybe we need a new religion, maybe we need to start something that is more pragmatic and…

640
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:39.920
Mike Nelson: is… is…

641
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:49.400
Mike Nelson: very much focused on norms for good behavior, and there's some of that. I mean, George Washington was

642
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.960
Mike Nelson: From a very early age, obsessed with books on morals.

643
01:13:54.290 --> 01:14:01.629
Mike Nelson: And he lived it, and he, he really, he really did live it, and that's why so many people trusted him to…

644
01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:05.140
Mike Nelson: Take leadership of the army, and then take leadership of the country.

645
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.800
Jerry Michalski: I offer you Fubarism, which is a placeholder religion that I have founded.

646
01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.819
Jerry Michalski: I put the website up.

647
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:23.050
Jerry Michalski: The question on Fubarism, which I think is maybe a good question for a future OGM call, is, if you got to invent a religion, what would you put in it?

648
01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:29.390
Mike Nelson: There is a religious… Church of Life, which was founded by two British comedians.

649
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.730
Mike Nelson: And, for about a year or two, it was the fastest growing religion in England.

650
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:51.329
Mike Nelson: What was funny was it was all focused on the social. It was about getting people to come in on a Tuesday night, and have a potluck and support each other, and the classes were not on biblical studies, it was on…

651
01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:53.549
Mike Nelson: How do you do estate planning?

652
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.150
Jerry Michalski: I don't know how… I don't know if it's still growing, but…

653
01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:10.360
Mike Nelson: Well, if you… if Fubarism gets off the… off the… off the, you know, gets… gets launch velocity, I… I will definitely…

654
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:16.849
Mike Nelson: submit a petition that you be the first saint canonized under the Fubar religion.

655
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.220
Jerry Michalski: Fabulous, thank you.

656
01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:23.020
Alex Kladitis: What was that… was that religion life? Religion of life, did he say?

657
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.550
Mike Nelson: I think it was called Church of Life, let me, let me see…

658
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:30.959
Jerry Michalski: I'm not sure that's the name, because that's… I recognize the story, but that didn't get me to it yet, so if anybody wants.

659
01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.769
Mike Nelson: Let me… I'll do a little… little background.

660
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:35.310
Jerry Michalski: Beautiful.

661
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.260
Jerry Michalski: Pete, please.

662
01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:57.479
Pete Kaminski: It's funny, Mike, I like that, the first thing, I'm gonna bring in religion, and I'm like, oh, thank goodness, somebody's gonna save us. And then, of course, I… in a way, the big organized religion

663
01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.979
Pete Kaminski: I don't know if I would even pluralize that, but the really big one.

664
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:13.790
Pete Kaminski: it's kind of the original crony, you know, crony commercialism thing. I mean, it's 2,000… well, thousand years of basically, you know, organizing and sapping

665
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:22.569
Pete Kaminski: people and… and conducting crony, operations. I… and… and Mike, to your point, I… you… you said in there somewhere.

666
01:16:23.490 --> 01:16:42.449
Pete Kaminski: taking advantage of people who want more simplicity in their life, you know, saying, hey, I'll sell you some simplicity, and, you know, it only costs some tithing and, you know, supplication, and, you know, grease the wheels a little bit so that the big man is on your side. No, no problem.

667
01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:55.400
Pete Kaminski: So, I think that's actually a trenchant observation about how we ended up with chronocapitalism, because certainly, you know, one or two of the big religions came first and set the stage for it.

668
01:16:56.230 --> 01:17:05.240
Jerry Michalski: And you only need to go back and look at, like, let's just say the Borgia family and the papacy, or, I don't know, pick a couple other little points in history to go

669
01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:09.150
Jerry Michalski: really deeply into crony somethingism.

670
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:14.029
Jerry Michalski: long ago. There's a time-honored tradition of this happening all over the place.

671
01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.969
Jerry Michalski: Maybe non-crony systems are the exception to the rule.

672
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:24.800
Jerry Michalski: And cronyism just is the background radiation? .

673
01:17:25.210 --> 01:17:33.219
Mike Nelson: Well, as I say, I think there's a spectrum between the 10% cut, the 90% cut, and the 100% cut.

674
01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.240
Jerry Michalski: Yeah.

675
01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:39.180
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, and then we've got 10 minutes left in the call, I'd love to take some time just

676
01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:43.920
Jerry Michalski: Thinking about the topic and the call, and was it satisfying, unsatisfying.

677
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.449
Jerry Michalski: Et cetera, et cetera. Just, like, feedback on… on… This particular topic and process.

678
01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.320
Jerry Michalski: Sunday assembly sounds, sounds right, Pete.

679
01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.630
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

680
01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:56.410
Jerry Michalski: Stacy.

681
01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:08.160
Stacey Druss: Well, I was really triggered when Mike brought up religion, because I think it's a huge piece of this in many ways. I talk to lots and lots of religious people.

682
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.020
Stacey Druss: And…

683
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:23.259
Stacey Druss: So I would throw out three things that I think are part of the problem. One, it's going back to what I was saying about the secrecy and the blackmail. A large number of people suppressing who they are sexually.

684
01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:33.559
Stacey Druss: Keeping a whole separate life, keeping all those secrets there, having to act out against the same group of who they are is a very big piece.

685
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.529
Stacey Druss: Another piece of it is

686
01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:53.859
Stacey Druss: a large number of people are convinced that they can do anything they want to do here on Earth, because on their deathbed, as long as they invoke the name of Christ, they are totally forgiven. Nothing else matters, they are totally forgiven.

687
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:57.290
Stacey Druss: And then the other part is the patriarchal piece.

688
01:18:57.550 --> 01:19:13.069
Stacey Druss: So, I think it's all wrapped up there. I mean, and I have no problem with religion. I love… I love the ritual piece, I love the community piece, I just think there needs to be accountability and transparency.

689
01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.260
Stacey Druss: And, yeah.

690
01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:16.910
Stacey Druss: Over.

691
01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:20.240
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Stacey.

692
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.910
Jerry Michalski: Thoughts about the topic and the call?

693
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:33.379
Mike Nelson: I just want to say a big thank you, and I learned a lot about particular case studies, and

694
01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:43.549
Mike Nelson: I guess I was reaffirmed in my conviction that more transparency is probably going to be the most important thing here.

695
01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:47.310
Mike Nelson: And that a lot of our current approaches, like.

696
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:57.290
Mike Nelson: monitoring every credit card transaction that a city councilman has are not really the right answer. I mean, somehow you change the behavior, not try to…

697
01:19:57.730 --> 01:20:03.760
Mike Nelson: Document the behavior, which… I mean, a smart thief will find a way around such things.

698
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:10.519
Jerry Michalski: I'm really interested in how healthy communities rein in these bad practices, sort of…

699
01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.679
Mike Nelson: And I probably have completely naive ideas about that, but I'm…

700
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:26.500
Jerry Michalski: very… Interested in how we self-regulate together, and out the bad actors, and not… Banish them, but…

701
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:27.980
Jerry Michalski: Call them in.

702
01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:37.750
Jerry Michalski: In some way. I really like, sort of, post… maybe there's a future OGM topic also about call-in culture, as opposed to call-out culture.

703
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:41.090
Jerry Michalski: Which is a lovely thing. There's a… I have a draft…

704
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:42.590
Mike Nelson: Is that trademarked?

705
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.670
Jerry Michalski: There's a woman, hold on.

706
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:51.680
Jerry Michalski: There's a woman… Who gave a really nice…

707
01:20:52.190 --> 01:20:57.819
Jerry Michalski: TED talk about call-in culture. She, calling in Loretta Ross.

708
01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:02.849
Jerry Michalski: Don't call people out, call them in. I'll post the YouTube link in the chat.

709
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.240
Jerry Michalski: It's really good.

710
01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:08.040
Jerry Michalski: There you go.

711
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:20.399
Jerry Michalski: And next week is a check-in call, and since I sort of skipped last month's check-in call, let's actually do check-in this next Thursday.

712
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:22.640
Jerry Michalski: So, stay.

713
01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.400
Mike Nelson: C, please.

714
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:28.829
Stacey Druss: That's exactly… Jerry, thank you. What you said is exactly what I raised my hand to say.

715
01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:41.020
Stacey Druss: The whole idea with transparency, there also needs to be some way of redemption and forgiveness, to be able to, you know, get back on track.

716
01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:53.019
Stacey Druss: I think of… what's his name, Michael… the one that used to be Mia Culpa. Michael, Trump's old lawyer.

717
01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.000
Stacey Druss: Michael.

718
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.750
Jerry Michalski: Oh, God. Yes, what is his name?

719
01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.590
Mike Nelson: Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen.

720
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.180
Stacey Druss: Right. Well…

721
01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.230
Mike Nelson: Ty Cobb is doing the same thing now. That's another one of Trump's lawyers.

722
01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:11.560
Stacey Druss: Or even, like, people who have, like, been, like, these big, whatchamacallit.

723
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:31.050
Stacey Druss: People who have stolen, or, you know, big-time criminals who then go back and give you security tips on what to do. Like, you still recognize that they did something wrong, but they have an expertise that you want to use. And so a lot of times, people will use their expertise

724
01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:40.040
Stacey Druss: But they're not… there's no punishment involved, or there's no transparency involved. And what I'm speaking to… okay, let me back up a minute.

725
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:46.580
Stacey Druss: When I was talking earlier about people saying, well, you have to deal with bad people.

726
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:55.390
Stacey Druss: I was… part of it has to do with the fact of bad people often have good information.

727
01:22:56.070 --> 01:23:02.060
Stacey Druss: And so, I think there needs to be a way to allow them to contribute

728
01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:12.869
Stacey Druss: But they also… like, I think of somebody wearing a scarlet letter. Like, maybe they need to have a scarlet letter that they get to clean up as they go along.

729
01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:18.069
Stacey Druss: So, I just wanted to… Talk about the redemption piece.

730
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:29.359
Jerry Michalski: Love that. Thanks, Stacy. I'm just noticing that I'm gonna have to wrap this call right at the half hour, because I have a different call that got booked right after this, but we still have 5 minutes.

731
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:30.889
Jerry Michalski: So, reflections.

732
01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.060
Jerry Michalski: Thoughts?

733
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.899
Jerry Michalski: Particularly interested in how our.

734
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.390
Alex Kladitis: Okay.

735
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:39.820
Jerry Michalski: handles this. Go ahead, Alex.

736
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.959
Alex Kladitis: I just want to say I feel this is the…

737
01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:55.459
Alex Kladitis: the best conversation we've had on a topic. I've personally learned a lot of different aspects of it. I really enjoyed it. Not that I don't enjoy the other ones, I think this was a lot of quality stuff coming out today.

738
01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.130
Mike Nelson: You said best conversation on a topic.

739
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.349
Mike Nelson: It's any topic.

740
01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.690
Alex Kladitis: Out of the ones I've participated in with you guys here.

741
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:07.099
Mike Nelson: Well, you made it so, Alex.

742
01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.639
Alex Kladitis: I'm not sure.

743
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:13.919
Jerry Michalski: We're gonna have to Breitbartize your… your…

744
01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:19.250
Jerry Michalski: Your thoughts coming back to you, so you don't think that when you talk, it's, like, just, like.

745
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:25.090
Jerry Michalski: stuff that doesn't, you know, matter. It's like, no, no, no, we… we love what you bring to the group as well.

746
01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:25.960
Jerry Michalski: Eric.

747
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:33.569
Erik Willekens: I think I'll bring in a symbol. It's a bit of a touchy one, because I don't really want to go into the World Wide Web, but still…

748
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:39.339
Erik Willekens: I… because it matters so much. I know an NVC trainer. NVC is for compassion.

749
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:44.799
Erik Willekens: And I actually know more than one that have traits from… of narcissism.

750
01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:51.329
Erik Willekens: or… or, like, what we call narcissism, because I think often it's a very… That's bad wording.

751
01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:56.889
Erik Willekens: And because of that, I started researching how to be compassionate with all these kind of,

752
01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:08.040
Erik Willekens: personality disorders, and all kind of dark, triad things, and there is quite a lot of approaches that deal with it in a more compassionate way. It's not a simple way.

753
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:13.189
Erik Willekens: It requires a very deep understanding of personal communication, of boundary setting.

754
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.449
Erik Willekens: But it's actually also really possible.

755
01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.520
Erik Willekens: And very under-trained, so there is a way.

756
01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:25.130
Jerry Michalski: Eric is a trained NVC facilitator, mediator, I think.

757
01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:32.840
Jerry Michalski: And, NVC is the worst named, highly useful technique out there. It's just a miserable name.

758
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:48.159
Jerry Michalski: But what kind of… Eric, stop me if I'm getting this wrong, but what it involves is that usually there's two parties who are aggrieved somehow, and you're trying to mediate between them. You try to get each party to articulate what the other party is… is… said.

759
01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:56.259
Erik Willekens: It's about feelings and needs, and, like, what do I really feel, and what do I actually need, instead of saying, this is what is wrong about…

760
01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:00.930
Erik Willekens: you, I say, like, oh, but I really feel any. That's basically…

761
01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:05.539
Jerry Michalski: Yes, but the little piece of jiu-jitsu magic that I'm trying to point to is.

762
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:16.980
Jerry Michalski: the act of paraphrasing what the other person said until they say, yes, that's what I said, and they accept that you're repeating back to them the thing they said.

763
01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:33.059
Jerry Michalski: That little act softens brains on both sides. And it's like a tennis match where both sides have to do that, and I think that act of representing in your head and speaking out without agreeing to it, you're not agreeing that what they said was right, you're just

764
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:39.050
Jerry Michalski: paraphrasing what they said. I find that that's a magic trick. It's fabulous.

765
01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:40.560
Erik Willekens: How's to make marriage?

766
01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.049
Stacey Druss: Sorry, don't you think that's something that they could teach kids? I mean, to me… They do.

767
01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:49.440
