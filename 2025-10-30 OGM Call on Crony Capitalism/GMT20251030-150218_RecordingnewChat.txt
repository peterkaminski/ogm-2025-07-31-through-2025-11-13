It distorts free markets by creating an uneven playing field. -- political favoritism, corruption, barriers to entry, rent-seeking (extortion?)

The country with the lowest amount of perceived public-sector corruption in the world is Denmark
1) Why Denmark is seen as so clean
Here are possible contributing factors (not definitive, just plausible):
Strong institutions: Denmark has a well-functioning public sector, judiciary, and regulatory system. Transparency & accountability: Public spending, access to information, and oversight mechanisms are solid, reducing opportunities for misuse of power.
Culture & norms: There's a strong public expectation of honesty, low tolerance for nepotism/bribery. For instance, in an EU 2014 survey only ~1 % of businesses in Denmark considered corruption a “problem” when operating there.
Business & investment climate: Predictable rules, low administrative burdens, and trust in public institutions make it harder for corrupt practices to flourish.
Sustained performance: Denmark has been at or near the top for many years in the Transparency

thanks, Stacey! i double-corrected it in my mind, and ended with the wrong initial!

from Doug B: A legal system is a system that defines a set of rules and defines a set of penalties for violating them. There is no intrinsic thing that says a legal system has to be moral, ethical, fair, or righteous.
