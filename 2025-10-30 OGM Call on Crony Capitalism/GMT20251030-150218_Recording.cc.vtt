00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the OGM Open Global Mind weekly call for Thursday, October 30th.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Uh, 2025.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Did I get the year right? Yep. How did we get… I don't know how we got into 2025 already. It's a quarter of the century.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's happening fast, it's going by real quick.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We were, uh, just commenting on marsupials.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, how clever… how clever the program is that you're born a little worm,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And you go out and you attach yourself to a…

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Nutrition, and then grow up.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Um, has anybody been, like, up close and personal with a kangaroo or a wallaby that has a joey in its pouch?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
like a pretty grown Joey with little legs sticking out of the pouch.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's like it's carrying a nearly, nearly full-grown kangaroo in there. And the Joey…

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The jury just, like, dives in, does, like, a little…

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Cannonball in, and its feet are…

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
completely sticking out that you're like, wow, that looks uncomfortable.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yeah, yeah, well, Joey loves it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
for both parties.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Um, and April and I got to feed wallabies and ruse, uh, when we were at a little wild park in Australia, and they are tame and delight… they're… they're cool!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They were very sweet.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Um, welcome everybody. Eric, nice to see you.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Um, even though you're on a call right now.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We have as our topic

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
how to render crony capitalism obsolete.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Which, um, Mike, was it your thought last week?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, I was talking about Coney Capitalism. We did a lot of wordsmithing and got lots of good ideas on which piece of this to dive into, but… for my money, crony capitalism and disinformation.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
are two of the drivers of all the bad things that are going on in the world right now.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Whether it's wars, or Trump. Or, um… repression of human rights in country after country. It just… It's what you gotta do if you want to maintain that network of dark money and illegal activity.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Was there no crony capitalism under progressives?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Oh, no, I think, uh… I mean, Maduro considers himself, uh.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You know, a leftist.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I would think that the MAGA critique of the left is that it was crony capitalism.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of the current, of the progressive, of the progressive American left.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, communism in some ways.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That, that there were…

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Yeah.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Well, we got two… we got at least two different themes here. We got… one is capitalism, and one is cronyism, and they… and maybe you want to take socialism in the mix, too, and combine them in various ways.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Uh, perhaps. I'm open for framings here.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Well, well, I think… I think crony socialism is a form of crony capitalism.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Mm-hmm.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Because it's all about the capital. Follow the money. I mean, it's socialism in air quotes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Yeah.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And certainly what's happening in Russia, for example,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Marxism never got a chance.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
uh, is crony commune capitalism, or something like that? Because, uh, the Sloviki…

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
is the name for Putin's former buddies from the FSB and the KGB and all those things.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
who basically went out and owned a lot of the…

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
when they privatized all the enterprises, a lot of those people went out to run those enterprises.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And they scratch each other's backs, and I think…

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I think one of the reasons Putin has such control over Russia still, even though he's eaten more than

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
1.25…

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
plus million Russians dead in this conflict is one of the estimates.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Uh, which is astonishing to me. Uh, they only lost, like, 20,000 people in Afghanistan after 10 years, and they left.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Hmm.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So, so the numbers are completely staggering to me that that many Russians can have died, and this is still a thing.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Uh, but I think the Silovichi are a reason why he can stay in power.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Jerry, why would you remotely call that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
communist.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Um, because it seems like…

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It doesn't seem… doesn't seem to be anything communist about it anymore since the fall.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I… yes, except there's, like, this, um, it's like, uh, there's a German term, Ostalgie,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Which is nostalgia for the old Ost regime, the former East Germany.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It seems like Putin is trying to regrow the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the former Soviet Union,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and happen… and using capitalism as a handy mechanism to do it, even though it's not that…

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
capitalist or democratic or anything anymore, right? So I don't know what to call… it's a kleptocracy, I guess. It's…

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
doesn't fall neatly into any category. So I…

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Yeah.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's not communism anymore, but it feels like there's some weird mutt mix of stuff.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Just to correct a statistic, Jerry, the 1.2 million number is.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
No, I thought it was dead.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
casualties, not deaths.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.000
There's an estimate that's been growing ever since the war started, and it just… it crossed a million a while ago. It may be a Ukraine-biased estimate, but it's not casualties, it's dead.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
No, it's CSIS… indicates that it was up to a quarter of a million people dead.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
total casualties, well, and that… this was a couple months ago.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Okay.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But, yeah, it is… but a quarter of a million dead, I mean, that's… I mean, that's incredible.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That's still huge, yeah, yeah.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And they have half the population of the U.S.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yeah, that was as of June. In The Guardian.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So our topic is crony capitalism, and we don't need to… I mean, I dragged this into Putin land because I was

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
trying to figure out, so what is this thing? You know, how do… that seems to be a version of crony capitalism.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Uh, on the planet.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I…

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And North…

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's the most extreme version, I would say, other than maybe North Korea and, um… And I guess Assad's… Assad's Syria.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Yeah, but I don't think North Korea would claim to be capitalist, where Russia would claim to be capitalist now, right? So…

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Uh, so it is, I think, the most extreme version.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I wanted to bring into the conversation

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
pretty quickly, uh, people like, uh,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Lawrence Lessig.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Uh, and his Root Strikers efforts. Uh, Lawrence has, uh,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Mm-hmm.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Lawrence has not had much success over the years, but he's been fighting the noble fight.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
against exactly these kinds of things for years. He lost Eldred versus Reno.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Way back in the day, which was a copyright, uh, uh, uh…

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
case that went to the Supreme Court.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that was a terrible loss. I really regret that that happened.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Copyright just kept getting worse and worse after that.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Yeah, world would have been different, exactly.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The world would have been different. But even while he was doing that, I was convincing him that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that's not gonna… not gonna work. I mean, the corruption caused by the copyright industry… is what's driving the politics of copyright and the policy.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And it is, it's blatant corruption. I mean, it's really, really bad how, I mean, these… Senators and congressmen are promised great jobs when they leave, and they get, you know, they end up.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:25.000
million dollar a year jobs running trade associations for RIAA and Motion Picture Association of America.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But also, just, I mean, it… it's incredible how they… invite almost every White House staffer to.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:53.000
movies at their special, exclusive preview theater. 5 blocks from the White House, and it's just… it's not… it's not that they're just focusing on the people who make the policy, they're… They're blanketing the… so that everybody thinks the movie industry is the most important industry in America.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Um, so I'm curious, let's pause what we've said so far, and let's get a little read of the room.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
under the topic of crony capitalism, what paths would anybody like to take into the topic?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Uh, let's not assume away. Go ahead, John.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Um, alright, so this is…

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
This is, I will admit, big. I mean, so…

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We never go for big. What are you talking about?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I asked indulgence.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So, uh, you know, of course, there's the transaction, economic transactions.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And all the things that go with that. You know, measurement,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
precision, uh…

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
gross ignoring of important non-monetary values, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a whole world over here of economics.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Alright? Then there's this world over here

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
of, um, democracy.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
policy. And there's this

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
attempt to, you know,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Keep the two separate. Uh, there's this idea that, well, people should be able to express their intentions, and those intentions should have consequences, and

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
That should work, you know?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And, uh, it's very fragile, and we all know how it breaks down.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Um, then there's this weird kind of middle territory that I'm going to talk about, and it's, um…

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
It has different… there are different models here. One… one model is, um…

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
you know, reputational economies.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Where people have influence,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that's a function of their reputation.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And there's, of course, we've seen the most, you know,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
problematic and obscene versions of this.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
In terms of the social media like…

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
button or number of followers, influencers, all that kind of stuff.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But I just want to kind of put that on the table, put it over there, and say, okay,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
What would it look like if we had a diff… is there something missing? Is there something in the space here that's missing?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that if we could make it, it would…

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
solve the crony capitalism problem and the disinformation problem.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And the idea I'm thinking of is something like…

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
a, um…

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Everybody has… and not everybody has a vote, everybody has influence.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And some people do have more influence than others.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Uh, but it's bounded.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You cannot be taken down to zero influence, and you cannot have more influence than some amount.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000
You know? And, uh, how do we get influence? Well, in an ideal world, you would actually earn

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.000
your social capital, not the way the Chinese do it, by saying, oh, well, you didn't say anything bad about someone, and you… and you didn't jaywalk.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
But actually, by doing things that contribute to the community.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Um, and how would we keep track of this? Well, that's a… there's a whole set of…

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
messy issues here. I think…

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I think if it's in the hands of the government, no. You know, or the hands of a corporation. I think it has to be a…

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
a kind of a quasi-public entity.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And, um, anyhow, this… this…

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
thing, this, uh, this reputational economy,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
can periodically

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
be fired at certain social problems the way… kind of the way a…

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Um, Civic Assembly does now. You know, we isolate an issue, we isolate some people, we say, you know, you've been selected,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You come out with a position on this,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
By the way, try to get a position that has…

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
supermajority. Acceptance within your group, and then… then it'll have a chance in the regular system.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So, I mean, this is a cluster of characteristics, and I admit that it's very loose and very messy, but I'm wondering if there is something

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
In the way of a reputational economy that's not controlled by the government, that's not controlled by corporations, it has

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
limits, top and bottom. There's a degree of influence below which you cannot be lowered, nor above which you cannot attain.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And that does have some input.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
to something like what we would call an election, but not with the

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
binary decisiveness of our current elections, more like a tuning.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
More like a, okay, it's October, and we're now gonna tune, and, you know, guess what?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
this thing you're trying to do, it's not… you know, you should do something else, you know. It's some kind of way of

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Nudging the public sphere with

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
the reputational economy.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Very messy idea, I admit, but…

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yeah.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I have, yeah.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Well, that's okay. John, have you looked at liquid democracy? Like, the attempts to do it? Is there an overlap there, or are you talking about something quite different?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Yeah, yeah, there's an overlap, yeah, and there's the, uh…

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I… I'm not recalling whether the version that I looked at had the reputational assignment. In other words, like, you pick somebody

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Who has your vote on… in certain areas? Is that also part of Liquid, or is that something else?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Mm-hmm.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I think… I think you kind of proxy… you proxy your vote, or at least you sort of join people whose opinions you agree with.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Yeah.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Uh, and that sort of moves, and then you can see how many people are…

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
are going around, uh, the different opinions. Go ahead, Eric.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
That is… that's just…

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Correct, correct, I used to be… It used to be in a pirate party that was actually building on.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Thanks. Uh, so, go ahead, John.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Literally, the software system.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Okay, so just, you know, I mean, I know that it's very messy raw material, but it's just raw material from which to potentially build something that is

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
In between, uh, civic elections and economic transactions.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
But then hesitated.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Um, also, I wish our friend David Baaville were on this call, because he did a lot of work in liquid democracy early on, is quite familiar with it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Uh, et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Yeah.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I also wish Grace were here, because, according to Kalia, a lot of the work that she and Grace and others are doing

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
With identity systems and other kinds of things, I think, move toward what you're talking about, John?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Yep.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
It would be interesting to know.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Gil, please.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah, thanks. Well, let's, uh…

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Let's invite Grace and Clea and other folks back for a specific call focused on that, perhaps.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Um, John, what you say is messy and fascinating at the same time.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I can't imagine how you think about something that's not controlled by a government or corporations, since those control each other.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Um, and I'm not sure where cancel culture fits into the scheme that you're sketching, but all that aside,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I wanted to respond to Jerry's question about the framing.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Um, I think we need to look at, um…

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:52.000
If we're looking at chronic capitalism and these phenomena, we have to consider what of these arise out of capitalism, and what of these arise out of cronyism, which is maybe an innate human quality.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
in human cultures, or maybe not.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Uh, but where do we see that, and where do we not see that?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So, I want to tease those apart.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Um, if we're going to look at these, uh, because I think each of them offers a very rich…

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
mess, if you will.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And, um, just by way of housekeeping, I'm going to switch to phone at the half hour, and I'll go off the call at the top of the hour. I've got a doctor's appointment, but I'll stay with as long as I can, and thank you.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Awesome. Uh, I did… did you want to dive into the separation you're looking for more?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Um…

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I don't know… well, I don't have anything formulated on that, but I think what the phenomenon that we're talking about arises out of both of those.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Uh, and so I guess, like, yeah, I guess where I go is the question that I… that I…

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Pardon me. The question that I ended with, which is…

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
To what degree is cronyism a, you know,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.000
common, if not universal, aspect of human affairs, or the other side of that question is, where do we not see cronyism arising, and what sorts of societies?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And cultures doing not see Cronius as a phenomenon. So maybe we can kind of, you know, back out of the question into looking at some of the fundamental

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
roots of it.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Uh, and then we can get to, you know, does capitalism or modern capitalism or American capitalism?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
give rise to more of that, or what are the phenomena that have more cronyism arise or not?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
within the variety of capitalist societies that we have currently on the planet.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So, maybe we need to redefine our definitions a little bit, too.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Is cronyism when…

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
significant chunks of…

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
business or control or power are given to our

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
buddies and allies.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Is that the definition of cronyism? Meaning…

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
We always try to vote for people we like, etc. I mean, human relations are all about who you trust and who you're gonna, you know, bring in to do stuff.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
we do… we…

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
The question is, do they get the rewards?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
We do favors for our friends.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Um, you know, we bend rules and protocols and so forth for people that we like.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Um…

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So we used to have the spoils system in this country, the spoil system was to the victor belong the spoils is the saying.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And if you won the election, you got to put your people in everywhere.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And then we created legislation to stop that.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Mm-hmm.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
There's actually a book type that…

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Yes.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I mean, we're mixing a lot of things together, and they're all interrelated, which is why we have to discuss the whole picture.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000
But you just pointed out that there… His cronyism in government, and then there's cronyism in the marketplace.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And in both cases, the test of whether you have crony capitalism.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
is whether friendships. are more important.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and alliances. are more important and have more impact.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000
then market forces, or… good policy. And it's hard to draw that line.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But that's kind of the test that I use when I say, oh, well, that country is… characterized by crony capitalism.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
They're clearly doing bad policy that favors a few people.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And generates a lot of profit for them. that they have no right to have in a fair.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
free market. So the two are related. You can almost think of it as a circle where.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
the policy is decided. That allows and enables projects.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Projects enable profits. For the select few.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:55.000
That then influences the policy all over again. So the money is changing hands as it goes… From the government… to the, uh, to the people who are… implementing these projects, which…

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Because they often have a monopoly, or have some other type… way to control competition.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
They get the huge profits, and then they buy the legislature, and… hire the Prime Minister's son.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I mean, it's just… it's… it's an ever… ending circle.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And in a lot of countries. for 200 years, they had that circle, and there was a understanding that there was a, you know, a 10% cut.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000
There were these facilitators, and… You know, the nephew of so-and-so, and they got a 10% of the cut, and yet things worked.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:45.000
After a fashion, and they… and things got built, and… I mean, New York City, in the worst of the… Boss Tweed days, managed to build quite the infrastructure.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Now, they had some advantages. There was all this new technology, and there was this flood of immigrants coming in.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
So even if they were taking 10 or 20%, they… Had a lot left over to do good things.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
It was crony capitalism, because it was obviously not.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000
being run to the benefit of all, and money was being diverted that could have been spent in much wiser ways.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
But I think this point of how do we define it is critically important.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And… and… I love John's idea, which is… you know, the problem is not… getting rid of the cronies.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
The problem is enabling all the rest of us to have some power, too.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And that's what they thought they were doing in Russia, all these Western economists came in and said, okay, well, we're gonna give.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:57.000
uh, all these state enterprises. Uh, in the form of shares.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
A share certificate in every pot. But, Gil?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Well, Mike, it did work that way.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
to Russian citizens. Everybody was gonna have… their chunk of this nickel mine, and that… oil field, and somehow it never… never worked that way. It wasn't decentralized, uh…

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Gil, can we just go according to order? Could you put your hand down, because you spoke a little earlier?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Yeah, sure.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Thanks.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Yeah.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Well, I would like to hear… he has a one-sentence intervention, I mean, I think he's right. I mean, the money… the shares were allocated, and then somehow… somebody went and, you know, reallocated them.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Go ahead, Gil, if you want to… if it's about that.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I will, and I'm a little confused, Jerry, because Eric stepped in with a comment before, and that was okay, so I'm not sure what the rule set is on… on…

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
short comments, but…

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Um, yes, Eric looked like he was trying to explain the thing that happened right then, and I saw him, sort of,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's what I was trying to do.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
So I called him in.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Okay, oh, two fingers? Okay, got it. Two fingers.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
That's a two-finger rule, yeah.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Um, my understanding, Mike, is that the shares were allocated, and they were very quickly scooped up by the folks that Jerry called that clever name before.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Silovicki.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000
So, you know, they went out to the regular people and said, you have these shares that might be worth something someday, but I'm gonna give you a bottle of vodka today.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And, like, VOOM! All of a sudden, all of a sudden, like, in very short order.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Because there was no protections against that as part of the scheme, the whole thing was consolidated.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
You know, if they say a bottle of vodka in the hand is worth two in the bush.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Yep.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
There you go. Stunningly fast, and I'm sure somebody has unpacked that story, it's a fascinating…

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Because there was some… there was some potential there for something very, very different than we've ever seen before in the world.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Yeah, I would like to see it. I have not… I have not seen…

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
And it was just killed, like that.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
This is… this is a little bit…

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Yep, yep, yep. Worker ownership of the entire economy. Okay.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
This is…

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Thank you very much.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Thank you all. Tiny tangent for later. One of the things I don't like about Hernando de Soto's…

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Okay.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Uh, economic theories that we should give people property… we should give very poor people property rights.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
is that they rapidly get expropriated of those property rights and then have nothing at all.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
So, it's weird. How do we protect people and ownership? How do we keep distributed ownership distributed?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
That's a really interesting question.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
if it's about a certificate or money, then it's purchasable from you, and then you're done. You don't have… you don't get that

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000
participation anymore. So, uh, maybe we come back to that a little bit. I want to go to Stacy, who's been really patient and, uh, actually,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Alex, I think, was in line earlier and fell out, so let's go to Alex then.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I was, and I was waiting, but my hand went down for some reason, so… by itself. So, can I come in now?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
let's… I think… I think if we make…

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I think if we make a little bit of noise on our mics, sometimes the hand automatically goes down, because it thinks we're speaking.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Alex. Alex.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Uh, so let's do Alex, then Stacy.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Okay. All right, thank you. Um, first of all, on the Russia thing.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I have heard quite a bit about it. One of the elements was actually.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
as you say, the stuff was given to the people.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
But there were a lot of people who didn't have one idea from another what the hell they were given.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And there was a lot of mob rule, and they literally went and… They would go to the old people, primarily.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And say, you are the sign over this thing through us.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
or you die, and generally, they kill them anyway.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
the number was hundreds of thousands to millions of people were extorted.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000
And a lot of them killed, literally. by the mobs. It was just a whole mob rule type situation. There's a whole load of work being done on that.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Anyway, not now. Right, so on this issue. Yes, we're right to be separating crony.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Sorry, we're saying crony capitalism because our system is capitalist.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.000
But actually, I believe cronism is… is independent of any political system. Once a political system, one's a system of self-interest.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Now, the only way I think, and I'm not… I'll say it, but I know it's impractical at the moment.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
is the power that the crony. cronyism has.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000
is… most of the time, is it secrecy? or by the time it comes out, a lot of time has gone past.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
So, one of the things you should do is, to me.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000
force the government and everyone. to actually… if you have a chat with a government minister, you produce a document that says.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
within hours, this is what we spoke about, this is the recording.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
this is what we said. So, ultimate transparency is what will.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
At least make people aware that something's in the offing, because a lot of it is hidden behind the scenes.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Nobody ever hears about it, or if they do, it's too late.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Now, the things that come out against it. those guys will come up and say, one is commercial confidentiality.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Personally, I think crony capitalism has become such a problem.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
that that is irrelevant to me anymore. they use commercial confidentiality for anything.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
They'll have a great big chat about how they're gonna divvy up.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
scratch each other's back or whatever, and then I'll put one number, one dollar a month, and say, that's commercial confidentiality.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
It isn't, but that's how they use it. The other one is, oh, it's… Secret Service stuff. You cannot say anything.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
My ultimate thing would be… If everybody's… every penny they make.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.000
is up on a blockchain. for anyone to look at and question, why did you make that amount of money?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
it's not comfortable, but at least we'd have a hell of a lot of information, and be able to say.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Why did this guy get this contract and made a few million out of the side there?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
when the contract had nothing to do with it.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
So, it's… is it practical? Could it ever happen?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I don't know, because these guys are pretty good at covering the tracks.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
under the name of secrecy. So, but the blockchain could give you a lot of transparency?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Even if you don't go down the commercial route, if every government.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Senator, whatever, minister, every officer, every time you spoke to someone.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
you had to say what you spoke about. And here's the recording of the notes of it.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Opt in the open, within seconds. Then, I think a lot less would happen.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
But… who am I to say that?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Um, a couple items there. Uh, the government of Estonia, when they got their country back,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
went all electronic. They were like, screw paper. And, uh, we're gonna just go electronic. And they did a bunch of very innovative things.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
They had a platform for a while, I didn't have time right now to check whether it's still active and going, but called X-Road.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Still there.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
X-ROAD, which they were actually starting to sell to other countries as a platform for government.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And I think, I think, I'd love to fact-check this,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
I think when they started, every elected official had to post their calendar online.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Uh, and then my friend, uh, Andrew Roche was trying to run for elected office in Manhattan years ago,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
And he and Mikhai Sifri were trying to get

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
One of their agenda items was,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
We just want people to post their calendars. We want elected officials to post who they're meeting with.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
That's it. Who they're meet… and could not get that through.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
could not get open calendaring through as a small

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
issue in an election cycle, blah blah blah blah, because…

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
you know, who you meet with is one of the things.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Um… oh god, not Scalia. When, uh…

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
A Clarence Thomas was being, uh, was being outed for receiving a lot of gifts and things like that.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Uh, he was going to these retreats,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:32.000
The retreats, it's not… it's not the money that matters in the fancy jet, it's the fact that those are places where people get to corner you and have conversations with you. It's the conversations that matter,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Not so much the money and the other goodies.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Um, so all these things are… are…

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
It's possible to legislate.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
It's just that you can't get people to do it. Now…

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
It could be that humans in America and other countries are really ready

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000
for a radically more transparent government, and that that would be part of a platform offer for a new party coming in.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I would like that. I think that'd be really pretty cool.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
that we're gonna get rid of this kind of stuff and do it in this other kind of way.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Stacy, thank you for your patience.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
The floor is yours.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I want you to go back and speak to the human part of the question.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:19.000
from the small and local. Um, so… When we go to our friends, it's usually because we're looking for a bargain.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
When I became president of a condo association, we had a rule in place.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
that if you lived in the building, you couldn't do work in the building.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Well, we had a contractor living in our building who became my vice president.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And I changed that role. He was allowed to do the work in the building, but we got the family discount.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And we showed all of his… all of the materials that he bought.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:53.000
We got his contractor's discount. We showed that the people in the building already trusted me. I had given them a lot of reason to trust me.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Everything was there. We saved a lot of money by using him, and he got the benefit.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
of getting the work. It was his home. It was our home.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
There was a mental thing going on where we all belonged.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
to the community. when I look at what's happening in New York City.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And I'm involved in discussions with Mondami, and I have people saying all these horrible things, and.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000
you know, this is socialism, blah blah blah. And I point out to them that this man has 90,000 community members.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
working together, and they will bring up theft, and I say, well.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
when… I mean, this sounds kind of silly, but… When you feel like something belongs to you in your community.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Even if you're gonna steal. You usually steal from outside your community.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
There's… there's just…

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
there's a lot of human nature that I do think needs to be considered.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And, um… I just want to say that I've had many conversations with many people.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And there's only two sectors. One would be the entertainment industry.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And the other would be in, like, finance. Where repeatedly, good people have said things that go like this.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Well, you gotta work with bad people if you're gonna make it in this business.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:32.000
And I always want to throw up. Um, now, it used to be that you didn't hear that in government, and that was because they were afraid.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
They'd be outed. People held secrets over you. Now it doesn't matter. Secrets don't matter.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
There is no shame, you don't have to worry about.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
being outed, because it's fake news. It doesn't matter. Nobody believes anything.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
So, I think transparency has to be a big part of everything.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:03.000
But I also think, like, when… Oh, John is still here. When John was talking, I always think of the jury system.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
And I like the idea of juries, but I wish they were juries in other locations.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000
where they have no ties at all. You know, I think that kind of… disconnect, but connect.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
could be, like, a good thing. I don't know if that makes any sense.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:29.000
But I… I think that, um… by nature, we want to be surrounded around people, we want to be surrounded by.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:37.000
And that part's a good thing. Which is… why we give business to those around us.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:48.000
But when it becomes bad. is when it's us against them, and there is no… diversity, equity, and inclusion.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Thank you, Stacey.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Over.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Conflicts of interest, all those kinds of things are really hard to untangle and get right.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
And it's part of… it's part of…

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000
how we can construct society in different ways, right? And different societies have different things. Gil asked earlier in the chat, why only Estonia? Estonia had this weird moment, Gil.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Where… where they just had a chance to reinvent things. Iceland…

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
I had a moment where they reinvented their constitution, and then the parliament failed to ratify it.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
So they did a great, great job.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Rethinking a very old Danish constitution that they inherited that they didn't like.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And then, uh, it didn't make… it didn't survive the political process, which is…

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
to my mind, stupid.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
I mean, if you've done some great work,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
That's unifying people, like, go for it.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Well, that's the reason, Jerry. Sorry, yeah, Jerry, because… the crony capitalists, or one of the cronyists.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
got to them, because they didn't want that to go through.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Yeah.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
In both cases.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Yep.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Eric posts in the chat that Denmark is seen as one of the lowest perceived public sector corruption… corrupt companies… countries.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
company, that's very funny.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
And here are some reasons. There's, um…

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Eric, are you familiar with the folk school system in Northern Europe? The Folkscholden?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Forkscolon, um, back in… I'll look it up, but…

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.000
There was a system of schools, and it turns out that in most Nordic countries, a third of the population went to these schools.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And these schools were really, really good about civic participation.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
that they kind of… they kind of turned out really good citizens. And it's possible that

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
The governments we have now in Northern European social democracies

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
are good and less corrupt and more trusted by their citizens because

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
of things like that. I don't know.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
flinging around theories here.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Alex, please.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:06.000
say, comment on that, Eric's ChatGPT point. Okay, so the way it's phrased this, lowest amount of perceived.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
public sector corruption in the world. Let's assume it's not ChatGPT making it misnoming.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
or whatever, mis texting or whatever, but… if everybody else had 100%.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Where is Denmark? Because it says. So, first it says it's lowers perceived, and then why is Denmark scene so clean?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Well, I don't think you can infer one from the other, because.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
if everybody's at 100% cronyism, and Denmark is at 95.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.000
there's still cronyism. So, what is the qualitative. or quantitative element of that statement.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And that's… that's what we're talking about. We're not talking about who's the lowest.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Or who's better than… we can talk about who's better than the others.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
But the fact is, cronyism… is there, no matter what the society.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
And I would… I would say, not just Denmark, looking at the way the Western governments, Western governments are behaving at the moment.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I don't think there's any of them as clean, in any way, shape, or form, including Denmark, given how the position's taken at the moment.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
in politics. Just the way I'm looking at it.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Sorry.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And I think… the other thing we want to know is.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
how are those numbers changing? I mean, are there countries that are getting better?

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Yeah.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Or is everybody going downhill? Into the cesspool of the swamp.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Yep.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
I'm Eric had posted some useful links earlier about Transparency International and a couple other, uh,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
organizations, and I think that the transparency, uh,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
info about…

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
you know, the surveys of global transparency are still pretty credible and pretty good and useful guides.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
And you were about to jump in and say something, Eric, go ahead.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Yeah, one of the… I didn't find a hand gesture symbol anywhere, anywhere.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
It's alright, it's under the heart if you're on a Mac.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Um. Ah, okay. So, um… Indeed, those, uh… I just want to say a bit of the whole picture that I sent in those.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:25.000
few links, but God's just links. So, one part of it is Global Action Networks. That's a guy, Steve Wardell, he wrote about it, and he basically… his principle is you have to work with all different actors from the.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
different worlds to solve a problem internationally. It gives you an example of the diamond trade.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Where, in order… for the… for the… it's like a slave trade, most of the… history, and they started cooperating with the ones that sell diamonds in Antwerp, for instance, the.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:57.000
There's a big diamond sector. Uh, to then, uh, create… uh, what is it, um… like, uh… I don't find a word. That's difficult, the next… Yeah, I trust Mark, there's another word for it, but let's say a trust mark.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000
The trust mark.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
And any diamond miner can get it. Uh, that is not working with saves anymore.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And then they have to also decide, do we work, then.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:21.000
how do we change those other that are still working with slaves? So they start… have to also start working with the ones that are still working with slave.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Right, so there's this in-between place as well. I think Denmark is perceived as one of the better ones.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
It's still not free from corruption, but it's… It's a place to look at.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:41.000
And by, um… what Transparency International does is looking all over the world, it's using indicators to see, like, who's.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Um, who's… doing what on which of the aspects of.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
of transparency, what's in order, what's not, and they're… They're updating yearly a list of.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Are these, uh, countries behaving. in a transparent way or not.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Then there's another one, which is circularized. They actually… in the whole value chain, it's very sensitive to share information.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Because once you're going to say, um. Once you're sharing information about any part of your value chain that is not.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Baving according to ethical values, that's also not good on your shareholders, and it will create an immediate backlash on your.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Um, well… on your… on your economy, on your business.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
So they do it… in a way that's secure, that's private.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Uh, so all the info… it becomes a way to show what's in the value system.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:52.000
what's ethical and what's not. to then be able to talk about it, because otherwise it keeps on being secretive, nobody shares it, so that's a kind of a smart way to tackle that problem.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
is to look into the… like, it's a closed system.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Where the people who are involved can actually start looking at the value chain and how to improve it.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:14.000
I think that makes much more sense than just, say, uh, show every penny. That's idealistically, that sounds good, but it's not pract… tickle at all. It's really not a realistic way in… for companies to evolve.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Oh, and that's also this point about the slave trade, like.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:26.000
you have to start… Talking to the people who don't do it well to be able to change them and work with the enemy, work with the bad guys.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
to make them less bad guys. That's a principle we don't like. We don't like to make our hands dirty as idealists.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000
there's these other guy, Kahane, who says, like. Yeah, there is power and heart, and they need to come together.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:51.000
a lot in power. You also need to be able to… Yeah, if you… if you're… wanting to deal with power and how to change it, you'll have to go into the places where it hurts.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Uh, that's another part. there's more aspects, but that's what my mental alacrity allows for the moment.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
I think you mean Adam Kahane, and…

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Thank you. Yes.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
And his book is Power and Love, A Theory and Practice of Social Change. I think that's what you're pointing to.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Yeah, and what they… yeah, and they're… their consultancy agency, so both Steve Odell and Adam Kahnig.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
are… have been in the same consultancy agency? I don't remember… Rios partners.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
It's Rios Partners, which is now owned by Generon.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Yeah, well, probably Rios Partners also did some evil things, but they… they also have a lot of really deep.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
multi-stakeholder processes that it makes sense, and that did change things.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Adam Khani was involved also in the process of.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:51.000
of South Africa one day… Yeah. When they changed from an apartheid regime, which is kind of still there, but it's also kind of better.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Mm-hmm. Um, thank you, thank you for bringing all those things into our conversation. Really appreciate it, Eric.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Um, Alex, please.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Thank you, Eric. Um, very interesting. The thought that came to my mind… is that what you're describing is excellent, it's happening.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:18.000
is changing. the… let's put it… the influence part of crony capital, or cronyism.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Vinflamm, because there's influence. But there's also criminality.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And everything you described there, to me. helps with the influence part, and by no means that's a great thing to do.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
But I would like to… what came to my mind is, yeah, that addresses the influence part.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
But the criminality is a big issue. There are criminals out there doing… making things happen.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Right? And it influences politics, it influences policy, and everything else. It's not just… the elective… what are we going to call it?

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.000
the normal things, non-criminal things. There is criminalism in crony capitalism, so if you go to Russia.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:06.000
this criminalism there, in addition to crony capitalism. I would argue there's criminalism everywhere, but it's… it's a bit easier to see it and run.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
than it is in the US, or. or Britain, or whatever it is that we are.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Um, you know, it's sort of… I could tell you things about corruption, but anyway, never mind.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000
So that's the point I was trying to make, is that there's probably a more nuance, but I liked what you said, Eric, because it addresses the.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
the normal, safe. version of cronyism.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Just to add, to build on what you're saying, Alex, there's also, um…

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
a trend to legalize a lot of things that you would see as immoral or crony or whatever else, just by

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Passing laws because you have enough power.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
that things that you would normally not have allowed to have happen are suddenly not illegal anymore.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
They're just not things you want to see happening.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Uh, but that happens in regime after regime. When you… once you get capture,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Once you get regulatory capture,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:07.000
you can effectively, uh, sort of whitewash what you're doing a lot.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Um, Eric, it looked like you were gonna…

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Jump in again?

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I'm still… I can't find this answer still, but, um, the, um… Not the one that puts up my hand, actually.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Yeah.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:28.000
So… yeah, I just want to give an example, like… I live in The Hague. The Hague has the… International Criminal Court and the Criminal Court of Justice.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
The big problem is, like. on an international level, it's very difficult.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000
for law to… the effect, like, um, Netanyahu has been, uh.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
on the list of, like, you have to, like.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000
bring him over to the International Criminal. Court of Justice. If he passes in your country, that doesn't happen.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
But… and that's… that shows, like, how difficult it is for an international community.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:04.000
to actually live according to laws on an international level. It does work a bit, but it also shows with Netanyahu.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000
like, how… Uh, our countries, they seem to be better because we're democracies, but then when.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Push comes to shove, we actually also become a bit crony, even on that level.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:25.000
And we are… I mean, they… The Hague, for me, is very hopeful in one way, because they actually do that, they actually put them up as a criminal.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
On the other end, I'm also very close to.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Rotterdam, which is one of the biggest drug trafficking hubs in the whole world, which is irony, like, it's everywhere, and it's kind of… And the Shell headquarters, like, right around the corner, so it's… it's all happening together so close to each other, which is kind of…

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:51.000
crazy. This kind of… Lawfulness, lawlessness, it's… it's happening in the same place, at the same time.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:59.000
like, 500 meters from each other, and it's the absolute opposite.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
I mean, this is, um…

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000
This opens up so many interesting questions, because what you were just saying made me realize that

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I have a thought in my brain, Trump and Putin are acid tests of the world's legal systems.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000
That, you know, if the legal systems can't stop people, and that's supposed to be the recourse within the system,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
then what… what does?

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Doug, you're muted.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Pardon?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Who said that? Who said that quote?

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Uh, that was me. That was just the way… that was a label I gave a thought in my brain, which I'll post into the chat now.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
I…

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
That's very wise. Very good. Very quotable and tweetable.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Oh, good. Doug, you're muted. Go ahead.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Yeah, I just, um…

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I think there's a tendency to conflate legal system.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:07.000
with a set of morality, ethics, and values. And they are not an equivalency.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
A legal system… If you look at the definition of.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
of law? Um.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:26.000
It is a system… for… by which a… society or state or other.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
defines a set of rules that apply to all.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.000
And that defines the penalty when. broken, breached, or violated.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
So the emphasis of… definitionally, the emphasis of law… what a law is.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.000
And what a legal system is, is. It's a system that defines a set of rules and defines a set of penalties for.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:58.000
By awaiting. There is no intrinsic… thing that says.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:06.000
a legal system has to be moral, ethical, fair, or righteous.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:20.000
So, to your statement, Jerry, I don't think… Trump and Putin test legal systems, Trump and Putin are just varieties of legal systems.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:31.000
They just happen to be totalitarian. authoritarian, their law governs, and everybody else marches to the order or gets shot.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:40.000
The common law legal system, the… in, you know, quaint old institutions, legal institutional.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
structures of, you know, what used to be the United States of America.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:54.000
purports to carry and bring values and… In service twos and all sorts of… plugins and add-ons and layers.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Um, but that's not… Strictly about the legal system.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
It's about, you know, in whose hand it's being wielded.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Um…

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
And with that, I'm complete.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Thanks, Doug. Partly what I meant was, when Trump was out of power in his interregnum,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
you know, post his first administration.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
He did not control…

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
any of the mechanisms of power. He had referen… he had amazing referent power within

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
the Republican Party.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Uh, that played out like crazy, played out just right for him.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.000
But there was a legal system that he did not control with a bunch of Trump-appointed judges who were ruling against him.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So I'm… Putin less so, because once Putin took control, he managed to, you know, weaken everything.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
and break institutions a lot.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
and put his cronies in charge.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:02.000
But I'm… I'm between what Eric just said about the International Criminal Court, which I'm, you know, slightly aware of, how…

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
how difficult and futile the work of actually bringing people to justice is worldwide.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Worldwide. I think I mentioned here, Mark Goodman is a consultant on crime. He used to work at FBI, then he worked at Interpol.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And I gave a talk at the Institute for the Future years ago, where he described how to communicate with one of his peers across the Atlantic,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
He had to go through channels, his message had to sort of work its way up, go across, work its way down.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
And then he said, and our enemies are just using email.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:42.000
that they're just writing to each other, or Signal, or whatever. I mean, like, you know, encrypted messaging, right? I don't know if we just write each other, and you could hear an audible gasp go through the audience. Everybody's like,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
wow, we're… we're…

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
really screwed, like, if we're forcing… if we're forcing enforcers to go through channels,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000
And, you know, hindering their every effort to do stuff. Wow. And, by the way, it's real easy to pass laws that cripple

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.000
efforts to corral bad actors. And when bad actors get in… when you get capture, how do you avoid… I think…

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000
I think maybe this is one of my particular fascinations with this question about crony capitalism is,

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
How do you detect, avoid, and then undo

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
capture of systems.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Gil, please.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Yeah, I think that's a really important question, Jerry.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
the anti-corruption mechanisms that we've put in place over the decades.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
came from good intent. Um, but they get ossified.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Uh, when I was CSO of Palo Alto, I couldn't talk to city council members outside of council meetings.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Unless I had the explicit approval of the city manager.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Yep.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:51.000
And no more than two of them could talk together, or three of them talk together, it's a violation of some state law.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:01.000
So, you know, there's good intention, and then… and then difficult mechanisms, and regulatory capture and all that, but I wanted to… follow on what Doug said. I think what he said about laws.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:10.000
is extremely important. It raises the parallel system that we have in human cultures of norms.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Uh, and shaming as, uh, as adjustment and control mechanisms, which of course have their own downside.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Uh, because they can suppress variety and deviation and individual freedom and so forth.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
But the question I've been mulling as I've been driving is this, is that, um.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000
I think we may have talked about this last week or the week before.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Um, when a lion… brings down a gazelle.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
kills it, drags it back to its pride to eat.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Is that crime? Predation is part of the living world.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Things eat other things. Things kill other things. We have parasites. These are evolutionary processes that are adapting.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000
in certain ways, and they're constrained in certain ways.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:05.000
And is what we're talking about just that? An organism or an entity striving for advantage and benefit, which all organisms do.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000
And there are various countervailing forces, you know, biological in the case of the non-human living world.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Um, institutional and cultural in the case of the human living world.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.000
And this is a constant dance of coevolution. And, uh, any thought of ever-ending it is folly.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:29.000
And the question is, what dance moves do we make to have the dance be something that we like?

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:37.000
And I'm complete with that question, and actually, I'm not complete. I'm in the thrall of that question.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Thanks, Gil.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Let's see where y'all go with it.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Thank you.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Where do we go? Why don't we go into silence for a moment? This… we've gone…

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
very quickly through a lot of things, and we keep dragging large issues into the conversation, which I…

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Which I love, but I find a little overwhelming now and then. So let me…

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
go into silence, and I'll bring us back out in a little moment.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Mm-hmm.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
everybody take 3 long breaths.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Just… inhale…

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Hold the breath at the top a tiny bit.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Let it all out.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Stop at the bottom for a little bit.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Inhale again.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Take it in…

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Hold it at the top.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Let it out.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Hold it at the bottom.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
One more. Inhale.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
fill your lungs.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Hold it.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And then let it up, and let…

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
whatever was troubling you, go.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
With the air.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
also a public service announcement, which I will make

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:57.000
often than I do, which is never… I do post these recordings to YouTube, like, right away, so what we say in here

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
does go openly into the world.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Just so everybody knows the ground rules.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I don't… I don't… I don't have a preamble. There isn't a place where, you know, all those kinds of things are stated

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
very often, so I think it's useful to know that.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:19.000
How many people watch a typical episode, and have you had any episodes get thousands of.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Oh, Matt, our viewership is massive. We get, like,

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Viewers?

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:29.000
15 to 30 viewerships for some of the most popular episodes. I mean, we really… we're really going.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
I just wanted to make that clear to people.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Yeah, and none of our episodes… none of our calls has gone viral that I know of, anyway.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Can I… can I ask… can I ask the question.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000
And it's probably…

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
But how…

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000
But what… what makes a person, out of all the YouTube material.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
What makes a person specifically look for our recording?

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Um, I…

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
They missed… they missed it, and they heard it was good.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Because it's…

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:02.000
I think there… I think there are people who have discovered our conversations unlike them. I know that one of my dojo mates, uh, regularly, you know,

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:09.000
browses our calls and will comment to me on the map about things we said, and it's like, oh, so-and-so did this and that. I'm like, oh…

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Wow, dang. Um, so I, you know, I think there are people who, uh, enjoy,

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:23.000
what it is we're doing, somehow. I like that. Eric, you were trying to say something a moment ago.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.000
there's… yeah, how long did it take for a bug to get recognized, the scoundrel?

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:38.000
And, um, it was a scramble a bit. He was not an easy person. But on the other hand, I shared this thing about embracing the groundless.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Countless ground, and this was a very deep… exist… existential philosophical conversation I had with.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:58:00.000
And it's this artifact generated in Cloud on… hard to be with the fact that there is no… no easy fundament… of positivity to hold on to in life. There's always gonna be more negativity.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
And that came up when you had this moment of silence.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:12.000
So, I just wanted to hand it… Like, we… we are… we were living in a world with a groundless ground.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Thanks, Eric.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Um, Pete, you gotta follow that.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
I cannot, uh, improve on that.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Living in a world with a groundless ground. Um…

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000
I wanted to come back to the YouTube viewership, uh, YouTube channel viewership, and it's…

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.000
It's… it's true that in the vast world of billions of people,

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Uh, they're gonna be, uh, a dozen or two.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Uh, who see this recording.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:53.000
But I also wanted to point out, and I don't mean to scare anybody or anything like that, but I also want to point out that…

00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Not counted in those views are the transcript getting offloaded to Gemini, and if…

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000
If, uh, Anthropic and OpenAir are clever, they'll also end up with that transcript.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Um, and then social network analysis will, uh, keep the set of these people

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Um, talking about these topics, and you said this thing in…

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
in public, basically, uh, forever.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Um, so it's, uh, it's an…

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
I appreciate, Jerry, that you post these, uh, these calls, uh, in public.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Um, and I wanted to just make it clear that, um,

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.000
counting YouTube viewers is not the, uh, not the only ramification of where

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
where this ends up.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Absolutely.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Absolutely, thank you.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Especially in the times we're living in.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Yeah. I have to say, Gerry, that you're absolutely right, because.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
you cannot imagine how uncomfortable it makes me when I finish the call.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And then I'd say, I think, oh, I said this, and I was gone to the world, you know? It's like… Because when I'm in the moment, I'm talking to you guys, I'm not talking to the world.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
if I was a politician, I'd be talking to the world, so I wouldn't say half the things I say.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It's a bit of a… you know, it makes me deeply uncomfortable, personally. If I could find the same audience.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
But without the transmission to the world, I'd be a lot more comfortable.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Totally get that. Um, in, um, in days of old, when I got out of grad school, I, uh, before I started my first job out of grad school,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I had a brief consulting engagement in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
for 7 weeks, so I went there and did some really cool work, and made some friends.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Who told me stories about the dirty war. And, um…

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
the stories would go roughly like, you know, you'd be in a cafe with your buddies,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And all of a sudden, somebody would say, hey, the federal police is here, and everybody would just, like, leap out the windows and race to get out of there.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Like, you did not want to be corralled.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And then, if they sort of cut people, they'd go to your home, they didn't necessarily need a search warrant and things like that.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
They'd go to your home, or they'd just pick up your address book.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And, uh, they would ransack your home, and if there was anything lefty in your home, and

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
The best musicians of that era are… joined the Communist Party as protest,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And then we're basically forced to emigrate out of Argentina and Chile and Brazil.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So a lot of them ended up in France and became really brilliant musicians and came back later to triumph.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
But if you had a record by Mercedes Sosa or Caetano Veloso, or something like that,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You might be disappeared and pushed out of a helicopter over the river plate.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
That, that, you know, that was happening.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But then they'd grab your… and I'm saying all this because then they'd grab your address book and lather, rinse, repeat.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They would basically go through your private contact list and your address book.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
In our address books are now very, very public.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000
in ways that are uncomfortable for anybody who thinks that we're heading toward those kinds of regimes.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And that is a piece of modern reality, unfortunately.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Doug.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
We seek wisdom in these troubling times, Doug. What do you have for us?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Well, I was actually… I wanted to respond what you… where you just went, but also to respond to.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:34.000
where Alex went. with that discomfort thing, and I was… and my… My question is, what if…

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:44.000
you existed in a space and place in terms of your own identity, your own Earth, your own values, your own consciousness.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
that, um…

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000
you had no… self-consciousness fear.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:03.000
or doubt attached to how you walked in the world, how you contributed to the world, and… what you said.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000
what you do. And… I'm having a very rubber-meets-the-road moment.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000
around that question. with my partners in being in systems at this moment.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
So, um… One of my partners and I found ourselves deciding.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000
with a new, relatively new client. to, um, with a little bit of a pracie.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
to send a transcript of our last discussion about that client.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Unedited. unadulterated, unfiltered.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Because both of us, at the end of it, looked at each other and said.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:03.000
there's nothing in there. that isn't 100% in alignment with our orientation, our values are being unsurfaced to.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And… Our difference, because we're being in systems that focuses on the being part, not on the systems part.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:38.000
what we're actually selling is exactly that. It's, you know, what's living for us in response to.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You know, the rule is nobody tells you your flies down and to left, you zip it up.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Nobody ever says what they're actually thinking. Nobody actually shares what they're feeling.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Because that's dangerous and risky. Um, and… Um, and I'm just sharing this because.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
there is an alternative. And consistent with that.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I also… So, have… don't carry fear.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
In these kinds of spaces, I've been online in Zoom rooms and recorded sessions.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Some posts… a lot posted, most posted a lot, some not.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Um, and… Um… I'll stand by me.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And I'll accept consequences. If the world and culture and society I'm living in decides that.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
it doesn't like me, um, I'll… I'll live with that too.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Um, so anyway, I'm complete with that, but it's just… Yeah.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Thanks, Zach.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Thank you, thank you for that, Doug. there's a difference. When I listen to you.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I hear wisdom. When I listen to me, I hear my… I don't hear wisdom, I hear my thoughts.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
No!

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And my thoughts, from experience, my thoughts are not exactly standard. You know, I tend to… I've talked to a lot of people about it. I've talked to left, I've talked to right.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
you know, and, you know, have a lot of non-standard.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:26.000
things. Anyway, but… sorry, Jerry, um, I was going to talk about that a bit more, but, um.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Why don't you…

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
we haven't… we've gone away from the crony thing, so do we want to go back there, and… I don't have anything to say on that. I just wasn't going to say anything more.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Why don't you, um, put your thoughts into the room right now, and then we'll take a little temperature reading about where we are on the crony topic.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Okay. My… my… thank you, Doug, for that again, I'll say it.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:54.000
my… the back of my mind, the biggest fear is that a lot of the… analysis of what people are saying and what they believe in is being offloaded.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Ultimately, do AIs, but even before AIs came along to.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:04.000
to systems. So my biggest fear is that my name, or your name, or Jerry's name, or whatever.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000
appears in some list. Because there are keywords that were used.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And then, you know what bureaucracy's like? Systems of bureaucracies and people.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
they don't know you or me, and then they'll say, oh, okay, here's… I'll press a button there, and here's under surveillance.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:40.000
For whatever. And before long. something will go wrong. That's what… worries me more, particularly now, because it's so impersonal and so… I haven't told this group, but… two or three times. Back in 2010 or something.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
My parents wired me some money. to Britain, right? From Greece to Britain.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And… the money was lost. I would call my bank, no, nothing's happened. I would call their bank. Yeah, we sent it.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So, I actually have to… four weeks or something, I went to the bank.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I kicked up many hell, because they kept saying, we've got no record of the money arriving.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And I was saying to him, but it's Barclays. Barclays here, Barclays there.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:18.000
They say the Senate, you say not. Anyway, so I really misbehaved in verbal means, and it's the middle of London.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
It's the international banking. Lots of wealthy people around.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And you've got Alex… effing and blinding and accusing everybody of… stealing his money, or whatever. Anyway.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So if I went, really upset. And literally a quarter of a mile away, someone tapped me on the shoulder.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And it was one of the employees. And they said… I'll tell you something now, if you tell anybody else.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So it's a few years now, so it doesn't matter.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
If you tell anybody else, I will go to jail.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:59.000
But your money's not lost. It's just that because it was over a certain amount, it's been flagged for analysis by the Secret Services.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:09.000
for terrorist purposes. And he said, the problem is they've got such a backlog at the moment, it's taking them 3 months to clear the line.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So you will get your money. But… but just wait 3 months. Literally, when they get through the queue.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Right? True story, I'm not making it up. And hopefully nobody's going to go back and jail the person that told me.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000
The advantage he has, or she has, I actually don't remember the face or anything else in such a state.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I actually don't remember what they look like. But… but… and guess what? Next time.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It happened again. So my name must be on some list. Every time everybody sends me money from overseas, bang!

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Except now they clear the queue faster, perhaps. I don't know, who knows? But that's what scares me.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Crazy stuff. Um, Eric, you found how to raise your hand. First, I want to thank you for that, congratulate you for that.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
But general applause, uh…

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And then off to you.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Someone work, um… about what… it's partly what keeps me having trust that it won't go.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:30.000
to the extremes in America. that the biggest chances that… Somehow, it will keep on being intact is because there's a very strong dissident voice.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:42.000
still allowed and able. And the moment… the dictator wins is when the voices of dissent go silent.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So, I do hear the true story, I mean… it's… and I think it's attention arc, like, there's a balance to be made, but I also want to name that it's… it's really… important. Like, if you're starting.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000
to criticize yourself, to, um… To hold yourself back from speaking truth.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You're actually also installing a system. of not speaking up. And I'm sorry for what happened to you as well, I mean, it's… It seems to be a very nasty situation to be in.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And at the same time, maybe thank you, I don't know, uh, for taking the risk of speaking up and being honest, and… Maybe it's not always the most handy thing to do, but there is something really positive also in it. Maybe that's what I want to say. It's maintaining.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
the dissident voices, which… Which makes or breaks.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:44.000
the rule of law and the. the dictatorship can be installed or not on a permanent level. There's this one country in the… Asian country? I don't remember which one exactly.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
that actually overturned their dictator not that long ago, a few years ago, I think.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And that was also because that was a very strong civic sector that kept on.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Mm-hmm. Thanks, Eric.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah, sounds right.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I think it was Thailand.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And of course, there's the famous example of Marcos in the Philippines.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Um, Mike, the floor is yours.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And how people power can make a difference.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I wanted to bring up the role of religion.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And… how that has… utterly failed.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000
To stop crony capitalism and corruption. I mean, it's really quite extraordinary. Even the Catholic Church and the.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Church of the Vatican. just riddled with corruption, and not, you know, not little… $100,000… stolen checks, you know, and we're talking… you know, hundreds of millions, perhaps more.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And often it's just because one or two people.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000
win the trust of, uh, people who don't really want to deal with all the complexity of.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:03.000
moving money. And they know how to move money, and they move it where they want, and uh… often can cover up their tracks for years.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:14.000
The good news is… Because we do have electronic records, and we have more and more tools to spot these anomalous transactions.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:21.000
people are usually caught. But it is… it is extraordinary that, um.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:29.000
all this business about the Ten Commandments and thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lie.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:40.000
it doesn't seem to affect people. Maybe we need a new religion, maybe we need to start something that is more pragmatic and.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I…

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:54.000
uh… is… is… very much focused on norms for good behavior. There's some of that, I mean, the… George Washington was… from a very early age, obsessed with books on morals.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And he lived it, and he really, he really did live it, and that's why so many people trusted him to.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
take leadership of the Army, and then take leadership of the country.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I offer you Fubarism.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Which is a placeholder religion that I have founded.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I put the website up.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The question on Fubarism, which I think is maybe a good question for a

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
future OGM call is. If you got to invent a religion, what would you put in it?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
There is a religious… a church of life. which was founded by two British comedians.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Mm-hmm.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And uh… for about a year or two, it was the fastest growing religion in England.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Yes. They were having, like,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.000
What was funny was it was all focused on the social. It was about getting people to come in on a Tuesday night, and.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:54.000
have a potluck, and… support each other, and the classes were not on biblical studies, it was on.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
That's not quite the name of it. Do you remember the name of it?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000
How do you do estate planning? I don't know how… I don't know if it's still growing, but…

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Well, if you… if Subarism gets off the… off the… off the, you know, gets… gets launched at velocity, I… I will definitely… submit a petition that you be the first saint canonized under the Fubar religion.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Fabulous, thank you. And, you know, if…

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
What was that… was that religion life? Religion of life, did you say?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I think it was called Church of Life. Let me… let me see if I can find it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I'm not sure that's the name, because that's… I recognize the story, but that didn't get me to it yet, so if anybody wants to look up what the actual

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Okay, let me… I'll do a little… Little background.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Thank you. Beautiful.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Pete, please.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Um…

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000
It's funny, Mike, I like that, the first thing. I'm gonna bring in religion, and I'm like, oh, thank goodness somebody's gonna save us.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And then, of course, I… in a way, the big organized religion…

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I don't know if I would even pluralize that, but the really big one.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
it's kind of the original crony…

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000
you know, crony commercialism thing. I mean, it's 2000… well, a thousand years of

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
basically, you know, organizing and sapping

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
people and conducting

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000
crony, uh, operations. I… and… and Mike, to your point, I… you… you said in there somewhere,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Um, taking advantage of people who want more simplicity in their life, you know? Saying, hey, I'll sell you some simplicity, and…

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And, uh, you know, it only costs some tithing, and, you know, supplication, and, you know…

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
grease the wheels a little bit, so the big man is on your side. No problem.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
So, I think that's actually a trenchant observation about how we ended up with coronary capitalism.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Um, because certainly, you know, one or two of the big religions came first, and…

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
set the stage for it.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And you only need to go back and look at, like, let's just say the Borgia family and the papacy, or, I don't know,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Pick a couple of the little points in history to go…

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Yeah.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
really deeply into crony somethingism.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
long ago. There's a time-honored tradition of this happening all over the place.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Maybe, maybe non-crony systems are the exception?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
to the rule, and cronyism just…

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
is the background radiation? Uh…

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Well, as I say, I think there's a spectrum between the 10% cut.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
the 90% cut. And 100% cut.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Yeah. Um, Stacey, and then we've got 10 minutes left in the call, and I'd love to take some time just…

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Thinking about the topic and the call and…

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
satisfying, unsatisfying,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
et cetera, et cetera. Just, like, feedback on…

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
on this particular topic and process.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Um, oh, Sunday assembly sounds… sounds right, Pete.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Thank you. Uh, Stacy.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Well, I was really triggered when Mike brought up religion, because I think it's a huge piece of this.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
In many ways, I talk to lots and lots of religious people.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
And so I would throw out 3 things that I think are part of the problem.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:21.000
One, it's going back to what I was saying about the secrecy and the blackmail. A large number of people suppressing who they are.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Sexually, keeping a whole separate life, keeping all those secrets there.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
having to act out against the same group of who they are.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000
is a very big piece. Um, another piece of it is.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000
a large number of people are convinced. that they can do anything they want to do here on Earth.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Because on their deathbed, as long as they invoke the name of Christ.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Good to go.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
They are totally forgiven. Nothing else matters. They are totally forgiven.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And then the other part is the patriarchal piece.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:05.000
So, I think it's all wrapped up there. I mean, and I have no problem with religion. I love… I love the ritual piece.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I love the community piece. I just think there needs to be accountability and transparency.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And uh… yeah. Over.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Thanks, Stacey.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Um, thoughts about the topic?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
End the call.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I just want to say a big thank you.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Um, and I learned a lot about. particular case studies, and um… I guess I was reaffirmed in my… conviction that more transparency is probably going to be the most important thing here.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And that a lot of our current approaches. like, monitoring every credit card transaction that a city councilman.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:04.000
has… are not really the right answer. I mean, somehow you change the behavior and not try to… document the behavior, which… I mean, a smart thief will find a way around such things.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I'm really interested in how healthy communities rein in these bad practices, sort of.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And I probably have completely naive ideas about that, but I'm…

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:24.000
very interested in how we self-regulate together and out the bad actors, and not…

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
banish them, but…

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000
call them in, in some way. I really like, sort of, post… maybe there's a…

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
future OGM topic also about call-in culture.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
As opposed to call out culture.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Which is a lovely thing. There's a…

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
have a draft post that's not…

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Uh, there's a woman, um… hold on.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Is that trademarked?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
There's a woman…

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Who gave a really nice…

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
TED talk about call-in culture. She, uh, calling in Loretta Ross.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Don't call people out, call them in. I'll post the YouTube link in the chat.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
It's really good.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
There you go.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And next week is a check-in call, and since I sort of skipped last month's check-in call, let's actually do check-in.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
This next Thursday.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So, uh, Stacy, please.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
That's exactly… Jerry, thank you. What you said is exactly what I raised my hand to say.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
the whole idea with transparency, there also needs to be some.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:41.000
some way of redemption. and forgiveness, um, to be able to, you know, get back on track.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Um… I think of… what's his name, uh, Michael… the one that used to be Mia Culpa.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Oh, God. Yes, uh, what is his name?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Michael, um, Trump's old lawyer. Michael…

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Cohen.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Michael Cohen. Cohen.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Oh, Cohen. Michael Cohen. Ty Cobb is doing the same thing now. That's another one of Trump's lawyer.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Right. Well, the…

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Or even, like, people who have, like, been, like, these big, um… whatchamacallit. People who have stolen, or, you know, big-time criminals who then go back and give you security tips on what to do, like.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000
You still recognize that they did something wrong, but they have an expertise that you want to use.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And so a lot of times, people will use their expertise.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
But they're not… there's no punishment involved, or there's no transparency involved.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And what I'm speaking to… okay, let me back up a minute.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:47.000
When I was talking earlier about people saying, well, you have to deal with bad people.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I was part of it has to do with the fact of.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Bad people often have good information. And so, I think there needs to be a way to allow them to contribute.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:13.000
But they also, like, I think of somebody wearing a scarlet letter. Like, maybe they need to have a scarlet letter that they get to clean up as they go along.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So, I just wanted to… talk about the redemption piece.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Love that, thanks, Stacey. I'm just noticing that I'm gonna have to wrap this call right at the half hour, because I have a different call

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
that got booked right after this, but we still have 5 minutes.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So, reflections. Thoughts.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I'm particularly interested in how a healthy society handles this. Go ahead, Alex.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I think this is… I feel… I just want to say I feel this is the… the best conversation we've had on a topic.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I've personally learned a lot in different aspects of it. I really enjoyed it.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Not that I don't enjoy the other ones, although I think this was a lot of quality stuff going on today.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
this topic.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
You said best conversation on a topic. In any topic.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Out of the ones I've participated in with you guys here.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Cool.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Oh. Well, you, you, you made it so, Alex.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Because… I'm not sure.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Yay! We're gonna have to Breitbartize your… your…

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.000
your thoughts coming back to you, so you don't think that when you talk, it's like, just, like,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
stuff that doesn't, you know, matter. It's like, no, no, no, we…

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
We love what you bring to the group as well.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Eric.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I think I'll bring in the symbol. It's a bit of a touchy one, because I don't really want to go into the World Wide Web, but still… because it's… my mother's so much.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I know when NVC Turner. Nvc is for compassion.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
this… and I actually know more than one that have trades from… of narcissism.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Or, like, what we call narcissism, because I think often it's a very… has bad wording. Because of that, I started researching.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:08.000
How to be compassionate with all these kind of, uh… Personality disease, uh… disorders, uh, and all kind of dark, tried things, and there is quite a lot of approaches that deal with it in a more compassionate… it's not a simple way.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
It requires a very deep understanding of. personal communication, a boundary setting.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:19.000
But it's actually also really possible. am very under-trained, so there is a way.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Um, Eric is a trained NVC, uh,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
facilitator or mediator, I think.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And, um, NVC is the worst-named, highly useful technique out there.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It's just a miserable name.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
This is the way.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But what kind of, if… Eric, stop me if I'm getting this wrong, but what it involves is that usually there's two parties who are aggrieved somehow,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And you're trying to mediate between them, you try to get each party to articulate what the other party

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
is said. And it's…

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:56.000
It's about feelings and needs, and, like, what do I really feel, and what do I actually need, instead of saying, this is what is wrong about.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
you, I say, like, oh, but I really feel any. That's…

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Yes, but the little piece of jiu-jitsu magic that I'm trying to point to is…

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
The act of paraphrasing…

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
what the other person said, until they say, yes, that's what I said.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And they accept that you… that you're… you're repeating back to them the thing they said.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000
That little act softens brains on both sides, and it's like a tennis match where both sides have to do that.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And I think that that act of representing in your head and speaking out without agreeing to it. You're not agreeing that what they said was right,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
You're just paraphrasing what they said. I find that that's a magic trick.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:44.000
It's fabulous.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
They do.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Jerry, don't you… Sorry, don't you think that's something that they could teach kids? I mean, to me, I always… But that should be, like, basic. That should be, like.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
It's in some school curriculums. There's a couple… there's a video I watched of first graders

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
elementary school.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:02.000
on their own, 3 kids went off to the side, and a little girl winds up being the NVC facilitator for two other kids who had a fight on the playground.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
And they work it out. Like, yeah.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
that it should be.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And they teach their parents.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I… can I pass the con to somebody? Would anybody like to keep this call going? And I have…

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Or shall I… should we wrap the call?

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
No, I gotta go.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Okay, let's… we've had a great call. Thank you very, very much. Totally appreciate this.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Yeah, we gotta go.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Um… see you next week for our check-in call.
