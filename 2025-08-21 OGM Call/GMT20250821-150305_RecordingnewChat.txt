@John Warinner Elaborate further on the ethical purpose, moral meaning, phronesis, andragogical praxis, reflexivity, virtuous sense-making, indigenous wisdom, cultural-moral humility, and epistemic equity, epistemic liberty and epistemic justice in responding to  this compound philosophical question. Reality is in the perception and biases of the observer. How might we use the offensive pursuit of seeking truth, discernment, verification and validation of evidence with the synergistic forces of co-intelligence  and indigenous wisdom for navigating clashing perceptions of reality?
