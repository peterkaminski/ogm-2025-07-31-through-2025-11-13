## Call 05: 2025-08-28 - Collective Sense-Making

### Participants
- Jerry Michalski (facilitator)
- Mike Nelson
- Gil Friend
- John Kelly
- Marc-Antoine Parent
- Doug Breitbart
- Alex Kladitis
- Ken Homer (closing poem)
- Kevin Jones (mentioned)
- Eric (mentioned in chat - filter bubbles)

### Key Themes
1. **Frustrations with Sense-Making** - What does "sense" mean? What evidence shows sense-making happened?
2. **Collective vs Individual Intelligence** - John: Sometimes brilliant breakthroughs, often just motherhood statements
3. **Divergence → Convergence** - Marc-Antoine: Need both exploration and decision-making
4. **Goals & Deadlines Critical** - Mike's UN/IETF examples
5. **Rough Consensus Model** - IETF "humming" for anonymous agreement, "rough consensus and running code"
6. **Doug's Critique of "Collective"** - Word "collective" sets up failure, negates individual agency, should focus on consent not consensus
7. **What is "Sense"?** - Gil's fundamental question: interpretation? shared commitment? decision-making?
8. **OGM Self-Reflection** - Jerry: "We haven't done much sense-making" - more like salon
9. **Shared Meaning vs Definition** - Ken's conflict workshop: 400 responses, "organ failure" example
10. **Pervasive Disinformation** - Mike: Active sabotage of sense-making

### Major Frameworks/Concepts
- **IETF Humming** - Rough consensus via anonymous humming (overwhelming loud hum = consensus)
- **Collective Intelligence Cycle** (Simon Buckingham): Sensing → Sense-making → Ideation → Decision → Action → loop
- **Divergence then Convergence** - Marc-Antoine
- **Consent vs Consensus** - Doug's critical distinction
- **Inclusion & Individual Agency** - Doug's core values
- **Sense-making as Evidence** - What artifacts/outcomes show sense was made?
- **Filter Bubbles** - Eric's frustration (shared context lacking)

### Major Stories
- **Mike's UN Frustrations** - World Summit on Information Society, delegates wanting more meetings for expense-paid Geneva trips, Syrian/Tehran reps obstructing
- **Mike's IETF Success** - Internet Governance Forum with actual deadlines and deliverables
- **Ken's Conflict Workshop** - National Park Service Yosemite, 35 people, 400+ responses, "organ failure" revelation about conflict meanings

### Notable Quotes
- Gil: "I'm not clear what we mean by sense"
- Mike: "You need complete consensus? That doesn't work - allows one or two people to hold everybody hostage"
- Mike: "Rough consensus and running code"
- Doug: "Anything modified by 'collective' is a major frustration - posits an aggregate thing that doesn't really exist"
- Doug: "Set up a premise for failure, then do the mosh pit metaphoric cockfighting as to who wins"
- Doug: "Consent by all individuals, not consensus"
- Jerry: "I think we've had nice salon conversations but haven't done much sense-making"
- Mike: "OGM has not written things, but several of us have used the wisdom of this crowd to write very good stuff"
- Ken: "Not trying to nail it down to a fine definition, but get it all out on the table - expansive and exponentially synthesizing"
- Alex: "I didn't know the purpose... I enjoy the discussion but could not find a thread... I'm oriented to solutionizing and there were no solutions"

### Closing Poem
Ken Homer: "A Note Passed to Superman" by Lucille Clifton - "Sweet Jesus, Superman! If I'd seen you dressed in your blue suit, I would have known you... There is no planet stranger than the one I'm from."

### Meta Moment
- Alex shared last week's poem "Afraid So" with family - kids said "great poem", wife said "that's not a poem"
- Gil: "Then it did its job. Can we define poem? Can we define good poem?"
- Jerry: "And that made perfect sense to everyone in the same way. Right?"

### Notable Observations
- This call was highly meta - discussing OGM's own sense-making (or lack thereof)
- Clear tension between:  
  - Academic/philosophical exploration (Marc-Antoine, Gil, Doug)
  - Solution-orientation (Alex, Mike)
  - Process focus (Ken, Doug)
- Gil pushed hard on defining "sense" - fundamental question never fully resolved
- Alex's honest feedback about being lost valued by Jerry as good closure

## Call 07: 2025-09-11 - On Collaboration (DETAILED NOTES)

### Participants
- Jerry Michalski (facilitator)
- Gil Friend
- Kevin Jones
- Mike Nelson
- Scott Moehring (instigator of topic)
- Stacey Druss
- Ken Homer
- Jose Leal
- Doug Breitbart
- Alex Kladitis

### Core Question
Scott's provocation: **Does collaboration actually happen?** Especially collaboration between groups with independent goals. Scott distinguished collaboration from teamwork.

### Key Definitions & Frameworks

**Scott's Collaboration vs Teamwork Distinction:**
- **Collaboration**: Unique individuals creating something they couldn't create separately, not just because of manpower but because of unique interaction. If you change individuals, you fundamentally change the collaboration. Named by individuals (e.g., chef & restaurateur designing restaurant).
- **Teamwork**: Roles are plug-and-playable. Take one person out, put another in same role, outcome same (e.g., kitchen executing recipes, bucket brigade).
- **Test**: If collaborators can't say what they're doing in the same way, maybe they're not actually collaborating.
- **Observation**: Most time, one person's vision, others getting on board - not true collaboration.

**Kevin's Ronald Coase Transaction Theory:**
1. **Discovery** - who's doing what?
2. **Cooperation** - one-off cooperations that work in that instance
3. **Coordination** - signals automated, roles agreed on and not revisited (e.g., train track width standardized)
- Partners vs Stakeholders: Partners on team, stakeholders have validation/resources you want to access
- "Social entrepreneurs express their delusion" about coordination

**Ken's 4 Conversations Framework (20 years of practice):**
1. **Shared Meaning** - Why are we here? What do you bring? What do you want to get out of it? Ends with everyone having sense of commonality.
2. **Generate Possibilities** - Improv exercises, explore what's possible (even suspending rules/physics), then choose what has best chance of succeeding with real constraints.
3. **Coordinate Actions** - What business school teaches: goals, timeline, critical path, resource allocation. (Most people start here and fail!)
4. **After-Action Review** - Who needs acknowledgment? What can we replicate? What taught us lessons? What did something unexpected (not "failure")? What competencies developed?

**Ken's Additional Insights:**
- Need conversational competency: "right conversation about right thing at right time with right people"
- Teams fail because they lack conversational competency, not skill/resources/intentions
- Humanize work: Know what each person looks like when stressed, how to support through conflict
- Dan Pink: People want purpose, autonomy, mastery

**Jose's Cooperation vs Collaboration:**
- **Cooperation** (corporate norm): Teams work independently, linear handoffs ("you do your side, I do my side")
- **Collaboration** (rare): Work TOGETHER in moment, developing simultaneously, not handoffs
- Requires dropping ego, letting juices flow, bouncing off each other
- "I disagree with Gil - it's rare to get true collaboration"

**Doug's Post-Industrial Collaboration:**
- Can we co-create without industrial age afflictions? (ownership, power over, ego, attachment, fear, scarcity)
- Not relating to humans as machine parts but as living emotional creatures
- Nigerian woman's foundation: Conduit/pipeline model, non-proprietary relationship with beneficiaries, networking with other organizations vs closed-system competition
- Co-create from abundance not scarcity, porous boundaries not hard, curiosity/appreciation not control

### Major Stories & Examples

**Jerry's Ugly Oranges Case (Management 101):**
- Last shipment of unique oranges, $1M budget, two competing groups
- One needs pith/peel for cancer serum, other needs juice
- Could split for $1 and spend $999,999 on research vs contentious negotiation
- Lesson: Investigate what parties actually need

**Jerry's Aboriginal Australia (The Biggest Estate on Earth by Bill Gammage):**
- 2/3 of Australia under active human management before First Fleet
- Mobile tribes managing complementary ways, no fences/ownership
- Plant spinifex near forest, kangaroos feed there, next tribe catches some (not all)
- First Fleet diaries: "Like a gentleman's forest - reach up, there's an apple, look down, there's a gourd"
- Collaboration with land over 30,000 years
- Sheep from ships "tear up this man-made landscape" - capitalism "quite voracious"

**Ken's Ancient Futures - Learning from Ladakh:**
- Before road arrived: In complete harmony with environment, balanced population
- Women had multiple husbands, husbands spent time in monasteries (population control)
- Everyone had shelter, food, education
- Irrigation commons: See water draining? Fix it yourself, don't call Public Works
- "Real collaborative commons architecture"
- Weak link: Teenage boy wanting to be cool like James Dean, shattered everything

**Ken's Banker Client Story:**
- "We have to obey stringent rules, no choice"
- Ken: "What if unlimited budget, suspend laws of physics?" (improv)
- Found several ways to meet rules AND feel innovative, fulfilling, growing

**Gil's Stuart Hill "Lie Boldly" Technique:**
- Farmers talking regenerative futures - mood down, boring, constrained, limited steps
- Asked to tell biggest possible lie about imagined future
- Room changed: laughter, play, vibrancy
- One: "Ran nature strip through 20,000 acres, birds returned" - spun whole ecological vision
- "Wasn't possible until invited to lie boldly"
- Episode: "Lying Boldly as Tool for Change"

**Alex's Rhodes, Greece Story:**
- Italians (WWI-WWII) created beautiful hilltop gardens above father's village
- Allocated 50-meter sections, each gardener responsible for specific piece
- "Nothing would have happened without collaboration" but direct individual responsibility
- Greeks let it go to ruin after

**Mike's "China vs America" Book:**
- China: Engineers in charge who want to construct
- America: Lawyerly society where goal is to obstruct
- One lawyer for one client can shut down $10B project for years
- "Should be concerned about investment portfolio if 80% American stocks/bonds"

### Closing Poem
**"Conspiracy of Silence" by Ken Homer (ORIGINAL POEM)**

"It's been quite while since I was among people where we were all silent together.  
I'm feeling a need to join with such people now.  
I'm feeling a need to be with people who are willing to shut up for a while.  
To be with people who want to be quiet. People who want to be still for a bit.  
I'm feeling a need to be with people who want to resist the impulse to make sudden moves.  
I'm feeling a need to be with people who want to spend more time and effort on understanding than they do on explaining.  
And to those people, I offer this invitation and invocation.  
Let us come together in silence and breathe deeply.  
Let us breathe deeply until we can stand with ease inside each of us.  
Let us breathe deeply until we can send with ease, connecting each other.  
Let us breathe deeply until we can look into each other's eyes and not flinch.  
Let us breathe deeply until we can talk about what we see in each other's eyes.  
Let us breathe deeply until we can breathe together in peace.  
Let us breathe deeply until we can breathe peace into the world, and most of all,  
Let us breathe deeply until we can feel the world breathe peace into us."
