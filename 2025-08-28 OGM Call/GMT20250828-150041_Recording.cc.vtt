WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yeah, probably… 4%? Now, I'm very ecumenical. I will drink anything that's good.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So how are you going to get it down from 52 to 4?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Um, this is the challenge. Particularly because some of the 52 are probably no longer being made.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Mm-hmm.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Or I can only sample them at the monastery.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But it's a good, you know, it's good to have a passion and a lifetime goal.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Exactly.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Mike, do you have to become a monk? Are there beers at the monastery will only give to residents and not to visitors?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Ah, it used to be that way, I'm sure. There still are a few that you have to go to the monastery to buy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But slowly, they're all going commercial.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, this is… This is the, uh, beer-oriented start of the Open Global Mind Community Call for Thursday, August 28th.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
A 2025. Welcome.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If anybody… if anybody's interested at some point, not today. But in… the iPhone came out in 07, so probably talking a couple of years. When the apps became a thing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Mm-hmm.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I wanted to… to write an app. So I propose to decide I had a connection to one of the biggest cider manufacturers here in the UK.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And I'll put a presentation together for an app. To allow, obviously, the brewery, let's call it, to connect to the people.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But also had a whole load of features that were actually, I thought, quite interesting. They never went for it. I don't think anybody's ever written it, but I would… Fancy. It'd still be a pretty good one.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Well, untapped will allow you to rank the ciders that you drink as well, and they have.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
To, uh…

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Information on them, but the great thing about the app is you never have to drink substandard beer.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You show up at a bar in Nicaragua or Sri Lanka.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And you can kind of go through the beer list and determine which ones are… You know, at least a 3.7.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They should add a little feature where you can take a picture of the menu.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And it'll just overlay the untapped ratings for you.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I didn't know that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Huh. Well, the Vino does that for wine. So you take a picture, you take a picture of the label, and it automatically pulls up the vineyard and the year, and…

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's… it's pretty cool. It's not as fun as Untapped, though, because… because beer is more fun than wine.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That seems pretty smart.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Um, well, we are, um, all about sense-making on today's call, and this is.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Since making about, uh… bacteria created.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Beverages that we love. Um, and uh… so it's interesting, I'm… I'm…

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Nominally, one of the reasons OGM even exists is as an exercise in or an exploration.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Getting the regular bots? And the WeatherTech mats.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Um, oops. Doug, I just muted you. Oh, except you just unmuted you. There we go.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Good. Um, so nominally, we're exploring the space of sense-making, and.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And sometimes we're doing some sense-making, sometimes we're just doing a salon, I'm not exactly sure, but I want to kind of explore that space, and I think several of you have strong feelings in different directions, so I'd love to bring those into.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The conversation, but I wanted to start. With, um, your frustrations around sense-making. Just, let's do a little talk just around frustrations.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Um, around sense-making. Which could include, it's impossible.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I mean, it could easily include that. John, please, you first.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Yeah.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Sweet, we hear you fine. Yes, yes.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Okay, let me get unmuted here, just a sec. Oh, you can hear me? Okay, great. Um…

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Well, you know, when… on the one hand, at the positive extreme.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
There is this glorious. Situation that can happen when people who.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Trust each other, eh, you know, maybe not 100%, but… 90%. And don't exactly…

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Know what they're talking about, or agree, but kind of discover, hey, wait a minute.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Your idea is… is missing this and this and this, and my idea is… you know, and then you basically, you see… something that neither one of you saw.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Or no one in the group saw ahead of time, and you say, wow, we… because we're together, we can put this together.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And it is… it's not a complete solution, but it's something novel. None of us thought of, and it's… it's a pointer. It's a… it's a sign. It says, hey, hey, go over here, go look in this direction. This is something you ought to check out. And… So that's the positive, and when that happens, wow, you know, you say.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It might all be worth it. But the other extreme, which is where we spend much more of our time, is.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Hey, you know, we, like, 95% agree. But somehow we can only come up with this little tiny 5%.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Uh, little, you know… motherhood statement that we agree on, and it's, like, so limited. I was like, well, wait a minute, is that all we can come up with? Well, you know, objections to everything else, you know.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And, um… You know, there's a little inroad being made by AI.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because it can look at the statements. That we're making, and say, yeah, you thought you were really far apart, but actually there's a theme here that you're not seeing, which is… which is… connects you. So that's a possibility, but those are the… those are what I see as the continuum, you know, the… the great breakthrough.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
When you… and then… which is the reason why people collaborate with people, even with people they don't like.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Uh, and then at the other extreme is where we spend most of our time, where we kind of agree, but.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We can only come out with a motherhood statement. Okay.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Great, thanks, John. Marc Antoine.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Yeah, uh, well, first, absolutely true. I mean, the… The point of collective intelligence to me, let me start with collective intelligence, and I'll get into sense-making.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Is… diversity of perspectives, like, the world is more complex than any one person can understand.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So you need the diversity of perspectives to. Understand the world, including other people who have.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Which are part of that complexity. And, uh, the difficulty of.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Reaching consensus. And it's well known, you know, start with divergence and then come to convergence.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And I think so much time and sense-making is spent in exploration, and that's absolutely necessary.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
You cannot converge if you haven't explored and negotiated and spent the time to.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Empathize with the other standpoint, and to really understand it. And… At some point.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
There needs to be a process. Where you say, okay, let's see…

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Can we make anything out of that? That either we all agree on, or that.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Some of us can agree to work with. Sometimes that's enough, right? It's, it's, it's…

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
If people… if some people say, okay, we can bring this forward. Like, for me, collective intelligence, which I've distinguished squarely from crowdsourcing, which is, you know.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
This aggregation without iteration. Collective intelligence iteration has to be part of it.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And improving on one another's ideas. And that's, again. Takes time. But being able to be strict about, let's go from this big map-making.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Which is important, to decision making. You know, I went… I once was with.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Committee that defined, or Simon Buckingham's some proposed a definition of collective intelligence as.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Collective sensing, collective sense-making, collective… ideation, collective decision, collective action.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And then you loop on that. Uh, I think those are all important.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But to go to the… from the ideation to decision. You need to be able to.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Pick out elements of the map and decide, okay, we'll focus on this, we'll agree on that, this is out of scope.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And this is, uh… This is only possible if you have a goal.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It's nice to map, but if you… unless… and sometimes you don't have a common goal to start with, but.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
If people have a goal, and then negotiating the goal may be part of the process.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But at some point, you have to say. We're not just trying to sense-make, though that's important, we're also trying to say.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
What do we do out of this? And the reality is a lot of sense-making also happens.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000
In practice, in working together, in living. The action together, because it's the iteration, that's the learning.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And if the learning does a sense-making.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Hmm. Thanks, Marc Anton. And I want to gently herd us toward the frustrations we have with this, not to go defining the space yet.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Um, and talking about the deeper issues, because I know we have a lot of people who have really great ideas about what this is, just… Can we stand the frustrations? Like, what… what's frustrating about sense-making, whether it's individual or collective, or anything like that? Mike, please.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I'm gonna go right to that by building on what Mark Antoine just said.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Perfect.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
In addition to having a goal. You really desperately need a deadline.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Or some… higher power that is pushing people.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Towards some kind of consensus. A lot of my negotiating. Experience, or at least my most frustrating negotiating experiences.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Have been negotiating over legislation. In the U.S. Congress.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And worse, negotiation about various. Policy statements and conferences at the United Nations.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
For instance, I was on the organizing committee for the Internet Governance Forum.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And that was actually about as good as it gets in the UN system.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Because there was a deadline, you were going to have a conference on a certain day, in a certain place.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And you had to put a schedule together, and you had to get speakers.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
In contrast, there's something called the World Summit on the Information Society.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Um, this was first held more than 20 years ago in, uh.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Geneva, and then in Tunis. And they were going to, you know, kind of scope out what the UN's role was in the.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Digital future. And unfortunately, there wasn't a common goal. I mean, we sort of pretended there was a common goal, which was to.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Develop some principles that, you know, would apply in cyberspace. Uh, the U.S. Was basically saying, what applies.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.000
In real space applies in cyberspace. Things like human rights. But the Chinese had a different goal. Their goal was to water down.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
The famous UN… human rights declaration from the 40s.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Uh, other people were there because. They liked going to meetings.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And particularly the guy from Tehran and from Syria, I mean.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.000
These meetings meant a whole week, expense paid, in Geneva. We were supposed to have 3 meetings.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
These guys made sure we had 5 meetings. By just constantly throwing up objections.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And that leads to my… conclusion about the largest frustration.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And I think Marc Antoine referred to this, and that is that you need.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Complete consensus, you know. Nobody objects. Well, that doesn't work. I mean, it allows one or two people to…

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000
To torque the whole process and hold everybody else hostage, and that just kept happening in these UN meetings.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Um, so instead, I recommend what the Internet Engineering Task Force does.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Which is rough consensus and running code. And so, when they develop a standard.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Um, in order to assess whether all the people in the room.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Are on the same page. They hum.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And so, if somebody has put forward a proposal. They will then let the room, after discussion, they will let the room hum.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And if there is an overwhelmingly loud hum. And just a minor dissenting hum.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:55.000
That's rough consensus. And the test, then, is does it work? And so, usually, in order to get support and to get people to hum with you.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You have to show that this actually works, and works with other standards.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:09.000
That the IATF has done. So that's sort of my ideal of sense-making, and I'm biased, I'm a techie geek, I spent many years at IBM and elsewhere.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Involved in the IETF. But the reason they hum is because people might show up.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Wearing a Cisco badge, or an IBM hat. And, uh, the corporate position might be different than theirs.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
But as an engineer, they hum… For the best technical solution, even if it doesn't…

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Help their company. And humming gives them anonymity. Long talk, but hope that's helpful.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Thank you, Mike. And, um, we're drifting again into solutions and what seems to work, as opposed to just frustrations. Um, if I can keep us on frustrations for just a wee bit longer until we've, like, put a couple good ones on the table.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:59.000
There's a couple good ones showing up in the chat. Uh, I think Eric was talking about, uh, lack of shared context due to filter bubbles. That's a great frustration.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If I can add one more, and that is just. Pervasive disinformation.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Uh, guilt, please.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
You waste a lot of time trying to fix that problem.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So when there's… when there's people actively trying to make sure that sense can't be made, that's a… that's a biggie, yep.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Yep. Um, I love the humming, Mike, thank you for that.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Um, guilt.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Even if it maybe is a solution. Your discussion of the people who wanted the meetings to go on longer, because there were expenses paid, reminds me of the COP, the conference on the Parties Around Climate, which is coming up in Bellam.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Um, in Brazil, uh, shortly, where there will be 600 actual decision.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Forming delegates and 100,000 other people. Overwhelming the city of Bellam, many of whom are there on expense accounts and happy to.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Be there for whatever purpose. Um… So, uh, frustrations. So, I'm frustrated with this conversation.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Um, and I put a comment in the chat that I thought might be seen as flippant, but it was really serious, which is, uh, I'm not clear what we mean by sense.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:16.000
That we are making… that we are sense-making about. I'm not clear what we mean by sense. Does sense mean… Coming to an interpretation of, quote, reality that is somehow satisfying to me or furthers my expectations or cares or concerns.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Does sense-making mean coming to some kind of shared interpretation? About something. Does it mean coming to shared commitment to action, consent, you know, decisions around coordination? Most of the conversations so far seems to have been about goals and decision-making.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Which I would suggest is a subset of sense-making. Um, and one that, um.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Well, I understand why people said that's critical. It also gets… can get in the way of sense-making. Premature attention to goals implies.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
A tacit sense-making that has already happened, maybe has not been spoken.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So I'm going to echo what Eric said about context being really important.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Um, but the fundamental question is not at all clear to me, so I'm frustrated that we're talking about sense-making with no idea or even sense of what we mean by sense.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And I'll stop there. Frustrating enough for you, Jerry?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I like that. Uh, that's good, that's good. And I'm surprised.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Okay.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
That nobody yet has talked about how little sense we might have made over time in OGM.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
That… I thought that would pop up pretty early, because… Because I'm a little frustrated by that.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Well, what do you mean by… what do you mean by sense, Jerry?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
That… I think… I think we've had a very nice series of salon conversations that occasionally connect people, that occasionally put ideas we haven't heard of on the table.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Cool. Mm-hmm.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
But we haven't done much sense-making. Um, that… but…

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:04.000
What do you mean by sense-making? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be… I don't mean to be an ass here, but I'm… I really… I don't know what you mean by sense or sense-making, or what you're frustrated about, and I don't come to OGM for sense-making, so… Carry on.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And if you'll get… and if you'll give me a moment, I'm trying to head there.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Okay.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Um, so I was… so I was first gonna do a round of what are our frustrations with sensemaking, and see what shows up, you know, what we put on the table.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Then I was going to ask, what is evidence that sense-making has happened?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Yeah.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:32.000
What tells you individually, just personally, that some sense-making happened. Or, you know, when you show up somewhere, when you look at something, when you see an artifact, and you're like, oh, oh, oh.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:46.000
That's really good sense-making, and I'm sure this is going to be pretty particular to each of us, like, we'll have different opinions, but I'm very interested in what means sense-making happen? What are the remainders? What is the evidence of it?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Meh. Huh.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And I was gonna head from there back into… Um, you know, what might we do about it, and how do we operate, and all those kinds of things, but we're sort of jumping straight in there. But Gil, I share your frustration.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Well, Jerry, you're being very hard on yourself. Um, I think you and I both.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Think sense-making is something that is documented in a document. It slides, it's a report, and OGM has not written things.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Not always.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
But all of us, several of us, have used the wisdom of this crowd.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
To write some very good stuff. So I think you… you need to look at the broader ecosystem that you've engendered.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Thank you. Um, and I really appreciate that. Let me go to the queue.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Um, and see what y'all think. But that's kind of where he was heading, uh, with the discussion, because I want to address skills issue, but I think we can't.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
You can get there, like, immediately, directly, until we've talked about some of these other things. Doug?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So, my biggest, uh, frustration.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Sidestepping the issue of what you mean by sense-making and Gil's issue.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Um. Is that this always starts at chapter 3 or 4.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And it doesn't really contend with…

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:16.000
The fundamental ingredients at play. So, first of all, anything modified by the word collective in front of it.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Is a major anointing. For me, frustration for me.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Because the minute you start. Voicing collective. It's sort of like, um…

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Use of the word we by somebody speaking. Um, you posit this… aggregate thing that doesn't really exist.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And then you set up. The B text for.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:52.000
A general feeling of failure. Because it doesn't really exist, but it's… it becomes this sort of conceptualized ideal.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And… but the we, which also does exist, never arrives there.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So it's sort of like, out of the box, let's set up a premise for failure.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Um, and then, you know, do the mosh pit metaphoric. You know, cockfighting as to who wins and who's right. So.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Just to sort of, like. You know, raise the fundamentals.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000
When that happens, what it also does. Is it… it… implicitly.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Zeroes out and negates the concept of inclusion. It negates the concept of individual agency.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Um, and it… it… turns things into.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Consensus… slash collective agreement.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Or alignment around a proposition. Rather than…

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000
The concept of arriving at. Consent by all individuals involved.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:16.000
To whatever a conclusory proposition or action or intention is. And to arrive at consent.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Means creating the generosity in the space. For all voices to be heard, for all turbulence or triggers to be processed and handled.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And for people to arrive at a place where there is.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:41.000
A general shared… understanding… of the same it at the center that's being discussed or wrestled to ground.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And, um…

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:57.000
99% of the conversations, interactions, and… And gatherings like this that I experience.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Um. Do that. And it's a major frustration, because.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000
The essentials of listening, of receiving. Of, uh, respecting, appreciating, and supporting.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Individuals in co-creating together and co… co-formulating together and synthesizing together.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Are considered… not relevant, and… not allowable in the name of efficiency and getting to a result.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Like, we can't do that. Because it'll take too long.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
We'll never get to an output or a product. And with that, I'm complete.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Thanks, Doug. It feels like you've put a whole bunch of fish on the table.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
That I can't quite distinguish from the others, some of which I disagree with.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
So I think collective intelligence is not a… Uh, my lapropism, or a misnomer, or a…

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Whatever. I think it's actually… possible, and I put in the chat, Quaker sense of the meeting.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Which is a method that Quakers use to discuss issues, and then there's the clerk, which is a randomly assigned position.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
We'll say, I think… I think we have sense of the meeting at some point, when not necessarily everybody has been heard from, but.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:37.000
There's just… and they will report back what they think the meeting holds at that moment, and Quakers… We use that as decision-making. Quakers don't believe in oath-taking or voting.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Um, which makes it, you know, harder in normal democratic or group function, we're like, oh, we'll just all put .voting or something, and… not voting on ideas is, I've seen, kill more good concepts in my life than I care to enumerate.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And then you're also talking about. Um, the pressures of time in the name of efficiency, we're going to have to skip a whole bunch of things that we should skip, and I'm like.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I feel like my 27 years of feeding my brain is sense-making, and I don't feel like I'm under a deadline or pressure to do it. I feel like I make it public in order to have some kind of conversations that aren't necessarily materializing.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I can… I can count on one hand the people who have approached me and seem to understand what I've done with my brain.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And engage me in conversations like that. Um, but it's… but it's my earnest attempt to do that, and I do that every single day. But it's a slow process that metabolizes.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Information that connects, that links, that leaves behind an artifact. Which is a little bit why, I'm sort of like… Mike was like, well, we think that it's a report or a product. I'm not so sure. I think sense-making can just be an agreement or a sense that something happened, or…

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:58.000
If anybody's heard the name… the word seniors, it's the idea that there can be a group of people that achieve something really special, and they have a sense of seniors, of genius, that happened in that scene, in that space.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:10.000
But I thought, that's interesting, and that might be a form of sense-making, too. I think. And here I'm thinking maybe my sense of sense-making is very broad, and might be broader than most of us on the call, I don't know.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Uh, but, um… But, you know, maybe a hive of bees is sense-making where the…

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Food gradient is going to send them next, and, like, which.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Which of the little pods to feed to make the next queen, kind of thing. That's a form of collective sense-making, and if you read.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Kropotkin, the scary anarchist, he's busy studying how nature. Comes to decisions that are… that work out pretty well. I'm like, that's pretty cool, sounds like sense-making to me.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Uh, with no conversation going on, right? Or some other forms of communication. Anyway… Um, and Gil has something about bees. Is it a problem with bees, or is it, uh, bee sting that you want to report in?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
No, no, it's an insight about bees I just learned the other day, and someday tell me why you call Kropotkin scary, but that's for another time.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Oh, that was totally irony. That was totally irony. Yeah.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Oh, thank you, okay. Um, because I'm a… I'm a big fan.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Me too.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
The B-Wiggle, waggle.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Um, so people know about the B dance. Bees… the bee waggle bees go out and find places where there's pollen and come back to the hive and do what's called a dance or a waggling that is…

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Huh, sense-making, or certainly communication of information about where the food is.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And efficiently guides the hive. The worker bees in the hive to go find the food and bring stuff back to the colony, but it turns out that 10%, 10-20% of the bees do not do that.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Do not follow the instructions. And it's critically important that they do that. The deviance is essential without it, the hive would die.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:52.000
So part of the sense-making process is the outliers. That do not accept the consensus, that go their own way, that go off the ideal, efficient, so-called optimized path.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And find other stuff.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
So are you suggesting that we rename Open Global Mind the Deviant Bee Laboratory?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Well, we've got, you know, we'll fight over biological metaphors. We've got the big fungus, and we've got the bee laboratory, and we'll have to make some sense of that some other time.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I like that. Thanks, Gil. Um, Mark Anton.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Okay.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.000
So, so much to get into. I was really… I wanted to react to the notion that.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:31.000
There's no such thing as collective intelligence. The, uh… I'm a big fan of the work of Hugo Mercier.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Who's basically claiming that. Human cognition evolved as collective cognition, not as individual cognition.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
And makes a solid argument that. The, um, cognitive biases.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Are actually very good heuristics. In a collective context, and absolutely unjustifiable in an individual cognition context.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Now, that said, other points were made, uh, with which I agree much more. Like, there is a danger of.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Premature convergence. That is totally a thing. There is a danger of… and the definition of us is… is…

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Do we agree, us exists? And that's always a big, big, big… issue, like, when I mentioned this definition of collective sensing, sense-making, and so on, but.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
What's the collective exist… the existence of the collective? Is a totally… totally a presupposition. And yet.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
All cognition happens in interaction. That is what I'm going to propose.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
There is… now, of course, that means the group is always being renegotiated.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Who's the insider, outsider, the inclusion, and putting the emphasis on inclusion was really important. Boundaries matter.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And… that said. Uh, I said my frustration had put at the top of the chat was.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
One thing I find terrible is illusion of consensus. When we think, we agree.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000
And it's actually way too fuzzy. To be meaningful and to be actionable, and to be precise.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:21.000
That is also a problem. And yeah, the group… can be a temptation to say, oh, we all agree, and there's such a thing as groupthink, and following the group, and saying… saying we agree, and being agreeable.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
To the group. So that is… Absolutely a real risk.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Uh, and yes, outliers matter for that. And, uh.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
A shared purpose is defined by the group. It's not already there, it's something that emerges from the negotiation.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And the groups congregate around. A shared action when the action.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Emerges from all these… Yes, individual, but mostly.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Happening in negotiation consensus. And so the group is… as much pre-existing as the product of the negotiation.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Of goals, and meaning, shared or not, and. Negotiated in action.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And the group is also characterized. By a certain… practice. I said, it's the action that defines the group.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And it's the tradition that makes the group exist through time.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Uh, there's a transmission of a certain way of doing things that makes the group.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Exist and have a boundary. And, uh.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And again, it may splinter, it may evolve, it may… all kinds of things may happen.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
But what defines a group? It's a shared practice, and as such, it's, again.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Crystallized, uh… the result of a. The crystallized result of.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000
A prior sense-making. That ideally, should be constantly renegotiated. Over.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Thanks for John. Um, Mr. Jones, and if you don't mind, Kevin, my external perception of your life, in some sense, if I could just riff on this at this moment, is that you are kind of on a gradient sense-making mission in your life.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Because you keep trying to find your way to what works, and you bump into stuff, and you bump into stuff, and you're like, well, you know, you did a nice job getting out of the dot-com implosion, and then you went into philanthropy.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Hmm. Hmm.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
And then you're like, well, shit, this is not working. There's all sorts of things broken in philanthropy. So you created an environment.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Where you can invite in a whole mess of people, which becomes SOCAP, and sort of explore that area, and then you leave that behind. You're like, you need to go build a new nest.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
But you're… I perceive you as always, like, heading toward this thing you have in your head that is sense-making, personal.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Um, about what's gonna work.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Hmm. Hmm. Well, interesting. Yeah, I see myself as a truffle hound, you know, I have that much direction.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
That's… that's a way to say the same thing.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Yeah, you know, I go sniff out what's next. But, you know, I've been reading a marathon of Ursula Le Guin's Hanish Cycle.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Which is about getting out of slavery, and, you know. Since making leads to definitions, which is a great… the first tool of the colonizer is sense-making to definitions.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
That validates land grabs and saying who's an asset and who's a person.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
And so I think, you know, it's… which is, you know, obviously happening with ICE now and those kinds of things, and I think.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Since making has been. More a tool of the conqueror than… yeah, I think it is sense-making, it totally is sense-making. It makes sense for them. No, it's… it's sense-making. Okay, I'm not going to argue with your chats.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Sorry. They say this is what is. That's what makes it happen.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Okay, I'm… I'm…

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And this is without. And so, you know, there was a revolt on the planet Yao, where the women said, we are no longer assets.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And the men came along, and then they said, oh, but it is a patriarchy. And they said, well, no, that won't work either.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000
But it was… since making leads to the powerful having the power to define.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And, you know, if you look at all land extractions, you know, the Marshall trilogy that made Native Americans a dependent nation, that therefore their land can't be an asset, and that they can't get a mortgage on it, and they can't get intergenerational wealth, was.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Completely like redlining, that, uh, you know, African Americans couldn't get a government mortgage after the Depression, and they couldn't get it after being in World War II with the GI Bill.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So, since making leads to a definition of the powerless. By the powerful.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:47.000
So, Kevin… so, Kevin, that was highly unexpected from my perspective, and I'm going to refuse to let you taint the word sense-making that deeply in my head.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Others may go… others may go with you on this, but I could say that speech.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Okay.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Enables the powerful to have the power to define, oh my god, we should just cancel speech. We should never talk about speech, because all these people who've used speech to control us, they're just bad people, and look what effect that's happened in our lives.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
It's the source of all colonialism, it's the source of all bad things that have happened, and like.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Eh, not really. It's the… it's particular uses of sense or speech or whatever, right?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Well, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's a really stupid thing to have just said, okay? Because the people rose up.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Sorry, Kevin, why did you say that that way? Why did you say that that way exactly?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I shouldn't have said it that way. Because I thought it was a gross.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Maybe it was a provocation or something, but why did you say it that way?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Misunderstanding of what I said.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Because I thought it was a gross misunderstanding of what I said, taking it.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
To someplace where it never was and shouldn't have been, and it was so… it just rubbed me wrong, and I shouldn't have called it stupid. I should have called it.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Dude.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
You didn't call it stupid, you sort of called me stupid.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Jerry, you've now asked him 4 times, he's answered 3 times, let's kinda… let's get escape velocity here.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Okay. I… I did not like that intervention. I was trying to move your idea into a different spot and see what it provoked, but it certainly didn't mean to provoke that.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.000
So… Could I say… could I… could I… could I try something here?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Yes, please.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Um, Kevin, I hear what you're saying, and uh… but it seems that.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
The women on whatever Le Guin's planet was, or whatever, are sense-making also. It seems that the people being colonized are sense-making also.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
They… they claimed their voice. And from…

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Well, that sense-making, too. So you're using the word in a very particular way of, you know, how sense-making is used by dominators.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
As opposed to sense-making itself, I think. That's how I'm hearing you.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
I think…

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Did you…

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Because we're all… I mean, you, in fact, in speaking what you spoke, were doing a bit of sense-making.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
In other words, sharing an interpretation that you have formed out of your experience.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
True. I, you know, okay.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Yeah.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
So, let's not get stuck on this. Um, I'm sorry this happened.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Sensemaking is a tool of the powerful.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Um, which I totally disagree with. If you read CAST by Isabel Romkerson, she's like, what happens is, somebody comes in, creates an artificial distinction.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Reinforces that official distinction in a community, and that causes all kinds of shit that is how you create a colonial power structure that works. And I totally agree that that's happened over and over again.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
I don't think that was sense-making. I think that was redefining.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Words for everybody, and then applying value, differential value, that normally would not make sense to any of the participants in the community, but that they are forced to live under. And for me, none of that was sense-making, it was re-establishing.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:52.000
It was like, um, you know, in Taming of the Shrew, they're, you know, there's the moon in the sky, and everybody's like, no, no, shit, that's the sun, and it's like, oh, oh, if we don't say that to the moon, we die. We don't get food, we don't get married, we don't get anything. So I kind of get where that goes.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000
But to me, that's not sense-making, and we can… leave… we can leave the debate on the mic for a second, if you want. There's a bit of a queue that's been quite patient.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Um, so how about class?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Yeah, so, um… Maybe because of my German upbringing and background, when I hear the word collective.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
It rings a completely different bell. Than what this conversation has been going on for so far, right?

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:34.000
And then you initiated the conversation saying collective intelligence. But somehow we morphed into sense-making, which is a completely different topic again.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
And it's connected, but… You know, so collective intelligence…

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:52.000
It really is, uh… like a mass movement, right? I mean, you… I mean, I'm thinking of herds of waves when I see collective.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000
You know, you have, uh, you have a consensus building. Where people maintain the same opinion.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Maintain a worldview that moves them into action. And that's what we're seeing right now.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Right? So, particularly… If it's in the context of our current environment, our political environment.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:26.000
This is… we are… this is a pretty ominous kind of state that we are in. We're in collective.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Intelligence is being manipulated. You know, to create a worldview.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.000
That has people do things in groups. That are rather harmful.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
So… so that's where… and… and I've posted a couple articles on.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
A definition of intelligence, first of all, you know, what do we mean by intelligence?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Uh, from a technical perspective. Um, and then what…

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:08.000
What are the… what are the influences, you know, of collective? And I'm really… Emphasizing that the conversation should be on what is collective.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Not in… what is intelligence or sense-making. But what does it mean within the context of collective?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Right? Because that's where we are right now, and that's an extremely dangerous moment in time.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
And we are completely skirting the topic.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Um, Klaus, thank you for the warning about how collective hits you because of your background. That's… super useful. Um, and I'm… my intent with starting this call was both.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Personal sense-making and collective, but the thing I'm most interested in is the collective part of it, like you just said.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Um, but I think without us on our own little sense-making quests.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Um, we don't get good collective intelligence in some sense, but I don't feel strongly about what I just said.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Mr. Mooring, please. Who has been trying to help us make sense on things with DSRP and other frameworks over time, and showing us his experiments, and…

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Please.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Hello, everyone. Um… So, one of my themes has been how the individuals aggregate to the group.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And when we talk about collective. There is, in a sense, collective is the aggregation, I believe, of.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:30.000
All the individuals, and I kind of… have been taught to think about it as a bunch of people on a beach in a giant clear plastic ball.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
And they're all walking inside the ball, and… It's sort of, where does the ball go? Well.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
There might be some who are trying to go this way, but most of them are going this way, so the ball generally.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Follows that vector. And the reason I bring that up is that.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I've been thinking about why we think, which is why we make a mental model.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Which is our sense-making, our collective, our intelligence, if you will.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And the conclusion I came to, and this is just… kind of my own, is we want to interpret the past.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
So we can predict the future. So we can decide and act.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:18.000
And so the whole reason to make. Sense, or to have a collective intelligence, is to inform.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Our predictions and our actions. And I think that that's an interesting way of.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Thinking about it from me, and I'm not sure. Others will riff on this, but I just wanted to throw that out there, that that…

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
A mental model is a prediction and a collective intelligence, to my way of thinking.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Is a… mental model held by.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
A collective.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Thank you, Scott. Market Tran, real quick.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:02.000
He absolutely agreed, uh, sense-making is partly a mental model. Uh, and a mental model update, but it's also.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
It's a storytelling, and a story, in a way, is a simplified version of the model. It's what can fit in a brain.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Of a very complex world, and it's also about negotiating. Shared, uh… sense of provenance and purpose.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:26.000
There's the… there's a prediction as utilitarian, let's get to a goal, and there's a prediction as a sense of being.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Somebody's a certain kind of person, in a certain kind of group.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
And that is… that is the other side of sense-making. It's a… it's also feeding identity, as well as.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Action. Purposeful action. Over.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Thank you. Doug?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:54.000
I sort of wanted to loop around. I wanted to loop back, um, to…

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Um… The difference between.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Sensing… Which is a thing that I do as a human being, and other human beings do.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Um, versus sense-making. And the shift into sense-making.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.000
One man senses another's nonsense. And that was you, and that was… that was you and Kevin.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
In that moment. And the… the difference between things that are.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:46.000
That are susceptible and intrinsic to being subjective. Versus the ingredients of… of…

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Of humans as living beings. And the way I experience…

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:03.000
The way I receive and take in information. The way I respond to that, and the way I respond to others.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Um… there are the… there are the sort of the ingredients and dimensions of that.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
But then there's the… transformation of.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000
All of that into. Beliefs.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Into frameworks and… protections and attachments.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000
And constructs. Which are all products of mind.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000
They're not of reality, they're of mind. And…

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
My… I would argue that the Quakers.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Or, in sense-making, they're sensing. In that meeting form.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Um, and…

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000
And I think, you know, I… align with… with what Mark just shared.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Um, in terms of…

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Understanding… Which is individual.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And with others. So, coming to a common understanding of whatever, fill in the blank.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Is intrinsically… you know, uh… an evolved… evolving and… and… and, um…

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Sorry?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Elaborative… process.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
So, she's a cliffhanger.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
I just needed Rick.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Um, you know, it is an elaborative process. And… is a constantly changing one.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:09.000
The… the illusion, delusion, like… addiction… that seems to prevail culturally.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Around fixing understandings in a moment of time, and then playing them forward.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000
And believing that they control future-to-be, rather than the future to be.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Being the dog and us being the tail. Is… is the challenge.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
And we love our… our constructions, and our models, and our frameworks, and our stuff.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000
But the truth of the matter is. That we don't have any control over what happens next.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:51.000
And the world we're living in is sort of a living example, that that's… the case.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
So, I'm complete at that.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Thanks, Doug. Kevin?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Well, again, I apologize for my overreaction. It just felt like you were doing violence to my idea, and I just was a limbic reaction.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
But I'm with Doug on collective and making, and I think.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:19.000
To me, since making feels like you want to come out with a toaster, when I think you should come out with a… You should have sniffed a sock that leads you down a trail.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000
And so that… and the collective is always, you know, the group is a conspiracy against the outlier.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:41.000
One of the reasons I knew SOCAP would succeed. Is I, uh… I started going to people, should there be a conference like this? And, uh, another guy said, you know, there were two groups.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Okay, this is… this story has a point. There's a group led by TIDES, and one led by Aspen Institute, and they were trying to define this thing, and I said, I'll do a.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Conversation map, uh, between them, and how they define it versus you, because nobody could agree on what to call it, and then we're fighting over definitions. And then they said, oh, you know, there's only 10 minutes worth. Then they said, there's no time, and they said, well.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Don't you want to know what the people who are not in the room are saying? And they said, no, we think we have the right people in the room. And I said, oh.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
What a great market opportunity. You know, they think… when you have the right people in the room, you have a summit.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000
And what we needed was a marketplace where the Byzantine and the barbarian could discover each other as unlikely allies.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Fortunately for me, they all went to good schools and had flown business class to their family's vacations.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:48.000
And so they were… they were not ready for somebody to say, no, I… these folks that are outsiders to you need to be brought in, and we can explain why they can be unlikely allies.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
There's our breakfast sticker, mic, bumper sticker, alert, sense-making is not a tester.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
So, you know, sense-making is not a toaster.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Uh, Dave?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Um, yeah, I mean, I think I just wanted to throw in, like, what I think of probably data points, but… I mean, I was, uh… Mark, you said something about the… in the chat, I think, about the…

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.000
You know, the individual doesn't exist, and… And except to the individual, you know? And I do think we're kind of caught between.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Uh, sense-making as an individual expert, you know, I'm trying to make my sense… I'm trying to make sense versus sense-making as a collective effort, which is I'm trying to make shared sense.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And… and the shared sense, I think, is where it's really… the idea that trying to convince people is violence.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Is, I think, more often in the shared sense space. Um, and I was struck by… my wife is working at Cal.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.000
And the new students are coming onto campus this week, and she was doing an exercise where she was asking them to.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Talk about their strengths. And she said she heard from a lot of them that they had a strength which was listening.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Um, and she thought it was interesting that that was, you know, such a prominent strength, and I asked her if anybody said their strength was debating, and nobody says that anymore.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:15.000
And I swear that's a… that's a… that's an era change thing, right? I mean, listening is a modern skill set. I'm pretty sure, you know, in a big chunk of, you know, CPAC and stuff, debating is still a strong force.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Um, but they have different effects on the sense-making, right? Um, and then the other… one thing I've been going… I just came back from Vermont, and in Vermont, where we… where we go to Blake.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:36.000
There's this big Amish community. So you have this Amish community that has this sense of their culture living surrounded by this Vermont, you know, traditional white.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Kind of whatever Vermont community is. And they're quite distinct, but they're still.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Coherent, right? So, they have two very different senses, but they both work.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000
You know, so I think this notion of an ultimate sense is probably a flawed notion, right? There's many of them out there.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
You know, it's kind of enough cooperation or something that you can… you don't end up killing each other.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Um, and then maybe the last data point was just one. I was listening to the Zach Bush, um.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Interview yesterday, uh, trying to figure out what he means, and he… one of these observations was that.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:18.000
That we don't have to worry about AI, because AI will never be able to understand.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
The way humans do, because AI has been trained on words.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
And it's… I think it's that map and the territory kind of idea.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Words have… we've trimmed words of a whole bunch of their meaning, you know, so we say, oh, the sky is blue.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:41.000
But the sky's blue, it's, you know, this wonderful, all this stuff that's going on up there. We use the word blue, it's so simple, and AI will never understand all of the beauty.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000
You know, and so you'll… you'll always have lost some of the sense of the… of whatever it is we're experiencing.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:00.000
And I was… I felt really good about that for about 3 minutes, and then I realized that, well, the AIs are going to be able to suck in all the satellite data in a bunch of different dimensions that I could never experience. So, still, the AI is going to be able to sense in many more dimensions than I can sense.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Um, so we should still probably be afraid of the AI.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:12.000
But, um… But I do think that, you know, we do our… in our effort to have joint sense-making, the colonialism part of it is this…

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Creating of the map problem. Right, where we simplify ideas so that we can then share them.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
But when we do that, we've lost some of the senses.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Dave, thank you. I think one of the pet peeves we haven't mentioned so far that you just put on the table is oversimplification.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:42.000
It's like, sometimes in order to get agreement, we… or we use a word that is simpler, but kind of good enough, or whatever, and we miss it. And one of my beliefs, one of my personal beliefs about this is that.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Excuse me. Um, two people can never really agree completely on anything. There isn't… twins, born and raised the same, are going to be… are going to have a different understanding of some setting, context, sentence, whatever it might be, and it'll be colored by the last thing they read, whatever it might be. We can never, ever.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Get 100% overlap. What we can get is close to good enough agreement where major things aren't going to destroy the thing that's important to what we're agreeing on.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Um, and that definitionally, we've squirreled down, chased down. Enough of the weasel words for words that might mean different things to different people.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Sorry, short story. A really long time ago, when I launched a service in 1990 for new science called Intelligent Document Management.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Our VP of Sales came back from a meeting with IBM completely worried.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
And he had… he had my issue of the review of Image Plus, IBM's imaging offer.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:47.000
All marked up in red. And, uh, he had just come back with a meeting with Dave Liddell. So I wound up, a week later, having a call with this VP at IBM, Dave Liddell.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And he starts out very thoughtfully, and he says, Jerry, I think maybe we mean different things by the same words.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000
And I'm like, what do you mean? He says, well, in your write-up, you said that ImagePlus was neither open.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Uh, North Strategic. And to us, anything that's that big an offer in the product lineup is strategic, and anything that offers even a tiny little window where you could poke in data and pull out data is open. And to me, open is like open source.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.000
And strategic means it's actually strategic for the business in some way, and we had a delightful conversation, and he became my client.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000
He signed up for my Intelligent Document Management Service. That was one of my early, early lessons in this.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Oh, wow, sometimes we mean very different things, and sometimes the context of the word is political internally.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And the internal context and the politics of it. Don't let you see very useful contexts that other people have for the same damned word, et cetera, et cetera. And we haven't even opened that can.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Um, anyway, there's so much interesting territory here. Jack, thank you for your patience.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Um, well, and thank you for that segue, Jerry, because, uh… What I wanted to talk about.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Is… first of all, at the highest level, sense-making, to me, is the left side of.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Theory U.S. It's the side where you, you do the sensing.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
And you organize all the data, and now I want to go into.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Collective intelligence, but I first want to ground the term intelligence.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:31.000
In the fact that all biological entities, all organismic entities. Uh, our model builders.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000
And… Basically, sense-making.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Turns out to be as much aligning… sensing on the data in front of you.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:50.000
As it is aligning the models in the room. And this goes to collective intelligence.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:58.000
And so, intelligence, in my view. As a model builder is how you deal.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:11.000
With expectation failures. Think about it. If you are anticipating… your model is predicting the future, and the future doesn't happen.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:18.000
The way you expect it, how do you deal with it? That's a degree of intelligence.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Um, it's… it's… it's… it's like the… the… the young child that first encounters a large, ugly bug.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:38.000
How they deal with it is they run screaming to Mom. Um… But eventually, as they learn more and build a bigger model about what the bugs are.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:44.000
They don't run screaming to Mom anymore. They may actually pick it up and hold it and look at it, or whatever.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Uh, I mean, I remember my son. Uh… at, I don't know, maybe…

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:02.000
A year and a half old? Walking over in Tennessee and noticing a gigantic.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Very, very bright blue beetle. Then he walked over and picked it up.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000
He wasn't afraid of it. He had a different model of the world than I do.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000
I… I… me, I wouldn't go near it. Um, it was just a Beetle.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:28.000
But, uh, to me, it was ugly as hell. So, through… through… through… through my model of the universe.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Collective sense-making. Is how the collective deals.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:40.000
With the differences in their models and the oncoming input streams.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Um, and… and… and… I'm going… I'm going… I'm going to use that just for a moment, sorry to drag you sideways.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:00.000
And talk about Marc Antoine's hyperknowledge. Hyper-knowledge, um.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Is about… this is… this… I'm channeling Marc Antoine, not putting words in his mouth.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:18.000
And he'll likely correct me, and that's okay. That's what sense-making is about. But my… my understanding of Marc Antoine is that you are.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:29.000
You have an ecosystem of… a platform which deals with multiple input streams.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:39.000
And allows agents of all kinds. To play with those streams as if they were GET repos.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
And what that's… and I think that that's a model of what the brain does.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:53.000
So… so… I… I… I've… I've read… I've gone and reduced collective intelligence and all of that to, uh.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Marc Antoine's, uh. Hyperknowledge, which is… which is incorrect, but it's… it's… it's my sense of what's going on.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Over.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Thanks, Jack. Um, class.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Yeah, along those same lines, I mean, I love TheoEU, and I've been an audience, uh.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Student of it. Um, intelligence really needs some definition, I think, because.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Um, it's… it really depends on the information that you have and the context that you live within.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000
So, for example, a farmer. Can be incredibly.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Intelligent about his soil, his land. You know, the, uh, influence of.

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Climate, water, you know, soil conditions. You can have a craftsman who works with a material, let's say it was wood.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Who understand, who looks at this, what touches it. And feels things about.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000
What he can create with this wood by carving it. That completely escapes anyone else.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:26.000
So is that intelligence? So, there are layers of intelligence, so as we make decisions as a collective.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:35.000
About farming, for example. Um, is the decision-making body really informed and knowledgeable?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:46.000
About what's happening in that soil. Um, yet make decisions that… may completely alienate this farmer away from his soil.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:54.000
So there is a… there is a hierarchy in intelligence. You know, that has to be built from the ground on up.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Into… into… into… into more narrative types of, uh… intelligence. And…

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And I think that's where you would need. An unbiased, unfettered.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Intention of form of intelligence that is collective. Meaning, being respectful.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
You know, to every layer of, uh, of intelligence that needs to be combined.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Into… into a common understanding. You know, and I think we are missing that, and…

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000
The… there is a certain arrogance in our decision-making process, in our political.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Decision-making process that is so far removed from. The reality of the natural world.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
You know, but just assumes that, uh, it knows. And so it's that.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Um, I mean, Donald Meadows, you know, the hierarchy of, uh.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Of a system. Where in every layer of that hierarchy, there is an embedded intelligence.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
That needs to be heard. And that needs to be… to be embedded and incorporated.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know, and so I think that's what we're struggling with right now.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Because we have become… we… our collective intelligence is so far removed.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
You know, from… from what I would just maybe frame as reality, the natural world.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You know, that we have gotten into a lot of trouble.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Thanks, Klaus. Um, let's, um, Marcaton, I know you'd like to jump, but let's take a short.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:50.000
So, let's break, and I'll bring us back in, and you can jump in. So, oh… Let's just be silent with this for a bit. We've been going…

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Hot and heavy for an hour.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Thank you. I'm… I'm intrigued and a little bit worried that all this interest in generative AI has caused conversations about intelligence.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Consciousness, etc, etc, to just bubble over. I mean, that pot is boiling over right now in interesting ways and places, but uh… Um, over to you, Marcant.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Uh, thanks for breaking the rhythm, because it is a matter of rhythm, isn't it?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I want to build over what Klaus was saying, right? There's… we… a lot of…

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
We have a problem with hubris and arrogance. We necessarily.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Deal with simplified models of the world. Because limited cognitive capacity.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And believing that our map is the territory is hubris. And for me, the whole point of collective sense-making.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Is… the act of triangulation and checking.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
You know, I have this map of the world that's necessarily partial.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And let's compare maps a bit to see what I may have missed, or what you may have missed, or what we may all have missed.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Um… And… it's a practice.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:10.000
The ability to… Listen, the ability to not hold fast to our conclusions.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.000
To our map. The, um… Habit of checking.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Were… the rigidity of our assumptions and the emotional stake we have in our beliefs.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And how we often bind it to our identity. I spoke of identity earlier, there's a positive sense of identity.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Sometimes identity is what makes us. Remember to act in ways that are pro-social.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And sometimes, identity is what makes us cling. To, uh, parochial.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000
View of the world. And again, it's all a practice. Of questioning.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Kind of taking the time to question. Why do I believe this? And I believe strongly.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
In… collective sense-making as an arena.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Where we may stop and listen. And be confronted.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
To other… perspectives, because that's important.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That's… that's it. I wanted to go and to practice, and… and learning. For me, there's a pedagogy of sense-making, and that's something we're working on with Jack, with.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Sensecraft, it's, can we make it into a game? And the question of tempo is.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Not fully addressed yet, but something I care deeply about. What's the tempo of…

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Reading through what somebody else has said and penetrating it, and trying to, okay, what does that mean? What does that mean to me?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
How can I not just react, but… build on, uh, and integrate.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
What was said? Over.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Thank you. Dave.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Yeah, I was, uh… I was thinking of maybe Mark and Jerry, what you'd said about AI, that.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000
My thought is that the sense-making is collective, but the sense is individual.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And one of the problems is trying to remember that the sense is individual, right? Because we then adopt our map and assume it's reality, and we forget that it isn't, and, you know, we have to go back and forth, and… re-update that.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And so then the violence comes when we try to take our individual sense and force other people to understand it, or to adopt it, which I think may be a critique of politics, you know, Mike, recently, that, you know, the technocracy was the effort of the elite to force a whole bunch of people to understand, you know, democracy, the good life, a whole bunch of things.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:49.000
In a way that they had decided was best, and then impose it through policy. And we're seeing a reaction to that, which is, I don't care how bad it is, but you're not going to tell me what it should be.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Um, so, um, but I was thinking, Jerry, I mean, and I don't know, I don't want to take you off the sense-making, stream… But I also feel like this group is not only about sense-making, right? Sense-making is one of the things that we do collectively.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And… and I was thinking, you know, actually, you know, the AI is a thing, it's gonna be there.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000
To me, one of the push… the forces that will be balancing against AI is human connection.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And I think we've been undervaluing human connection. Ken, we need you, you know. Back in this game, kind of, because… we have a whole bunch of technologies that support human connection, and human connection does.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Sense-making is one of its things, but it's… there's so many things that human connection does, right? It's a… it's a fundamental relationship.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And I think we've been… we've kind of… I would say, in a societal way, perhaps we have under… you know, this is… maybe it's… it's Putnam and, and, and, um.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Social capital kinds of analysis, right? But… We… we have a lot of skills and techniques that kind of reinforce and strengthen human.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Human connection, and I actually think, OGM, one of the really magical things about it is this collection of people who know so much about human connection getting together and connecting with each other, but we actually could be much more devoted to the idea of increasing connection.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Right? I mean, there's, you know, there's tools, there are ideas, there's experiences that we have.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That are really special, that I think could, um… could really make a contribution to global human connection.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Which we're really going to want.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Um, Dave, thank you. Let's just be quiet with that for just a second.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Let's see… worth sitting with.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
You also made me think that human connection is sometimes a shortcut to sense-making.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Meaning, if I bond with somebody in whatever way. And I really trust them, and something they do makes me realize that their advice or point of view on things is good.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I will slide over and adopt a lot of their points of view, a lot of the way… a lot of the sense-making that I infer.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.000
From what they say and do. And happily, you know, inhabit that space, I think. It's, uh, the trusted connection is, uh…

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:26.000
A shortcut or a shorthand. To the logical process of making your way through facts or whatever it is, and then.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Earlier, I was thinking that there's some sense-making that has nothing to do with facts and logic. It's all about story and connection, and uh… And those are important as well. Those are a form of sense-making.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Um, as well. Mike?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:51.000
A lot of richness there, and some of the previous comments. I don't think I've ever seen so much material in the chat, or so much good material.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I just wanted to add on to that idea that human connection is sort of the foundation.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And say that one way we make sense and… ShareSense is through.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Stories. And a lot of them aren't true. A lot of them are fairy tales. The truth in the Bible is probably more… in the stories of how humans have interacted.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And how there might be some greater power. Than it is in the specific…

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Principles that you're supposed to live your life around. I mean, Deuteronomy is not a.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Good. Outline to define how you live your life.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But some of the parables of Jesus, like the Good Samaritan, I think are.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.000
So, uh, I hope that at some point we'll spend more time on, uh, powerful untruths, or powerful untruths.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Narratives. And that is what. The MAGA people have done so well. I mean, they know full well that the Haitians weren't eating dogs.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:17.000
But, boy, that, that was a story that they all told each other, and… It had the added virtue of owning the libs and making them upset that such a lie would go so far and influence so many people.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:26.000
So I just want to… I talked earlier about how sense often is reflected in a negotiated document.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Uh, I think sense is also more powerfully. Conveyed in a story.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And I'll just finish with one reference, one footnote. One of the most powerful things I've ever read in the Harvard Business Review.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000
More than 15 years old, is called the CEO as Storyteller.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And it's a brilliant. 7 or 8-page essay with lots of examples.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Of how, by changing the way a company thought. By telling just a couple stories.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Ceos can change the game, particularly a new CEO who's coming in to… fix a big mess.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Over.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Um, thanks, Mark.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I didn't test that link, I hope it still works. But that should be the article at HVS.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
It's… it's broken. I gave another one, I'm not sure it's the right one.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Well, thank you. This was an article by Bronwyn Fryer and Robert McKee.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I'll, uh, called Happy Tales. I'll put the title in, and then we can find a good link, and I'll correct the link in my brain. Thanks.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Rick?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Yeah, I've been using my silence to use co-intelligence about collective intelligence and the wisdom of the crowd.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And I came up with a… I was just asking questions to AI as we were going through.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And this is very crude, because typically when you do something like that, you form a question, you formulate, you iterate on it, but… so this is just a… a sort of, um… about 10 questions that came to mind.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And we don't have time to do justice to any of them.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
But I think it speaks to how to create an inquiry mine.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And, um, you know, Mike, last week, we talked about the meaning of hen.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And you are encouraging me to simplify it. And actually, I think I've come up with a good rationale for not doing it, and just calling it N.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Um, because, um, you know, I got sort of lambasted by 3 people by saying, I've got to simplify it, simplify it, simplify it.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:47.000
That's the KISS principle. Yes, it has its merit, but I think somebody said during this conversation that sometimes when you simplify a word.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:56.000
It loses some of the original meaning. And so, the, uh, the construct of this learning process.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Is different to what we're experiencing now. And I invite… I'll put a link into that if people are curious about a different type of learning method.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
That goes against the grain of what we've been taught, and the whole purpose of it, actually, is to shift.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
From fast thinking to slow thinking. Uh, because most of the time we're in these groups.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
We pause a little bit. We may do a little slow thinking, but it's sort of rapid fire.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You know, um, communication. And it doesn't allow space, so the slow thinking can happen afterwards.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.000
But one thing I haven't done yet, and I was wondering if anybody else has had, but Plexity has the capacity of doing group work.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And I was wondering whether anybody's had an experience with it, because what I just shared could be.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Something that could be group work, people who'd look at the questions.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:57.000
You know, disagree, or whatever it is, and try and prove it, but… uh, you know, there are people who are… still remain highly skeptical of AI and what it can do for us.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But what I think it's good at is lowering the floor of ignorance so that we can actually.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Raise our collective wisdom. Um, and they can scope things out far better quicker. I mean, for example, through this conversation.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
One thing that kept ricocheting through my mind was sociocracy. Now, that's just one method.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Of dealing with, uh… it's a different methodology for thinking about how groups can work together, where.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It's not consensus, it's consent. And that's different. That means everyone's objections to whatever's agreed is honored.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
You build mill… you build some middle ground where you say, is this good enough to move forward?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And then you can iterate. Based upon what your experiences of doing wicked problems, such that somebody's…

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000
The outlier may have had the most important contribution, but got marginalized.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And it may come to pass that that person. Contribution was the most important, so it can be incorporated in.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:06.000
So I think there's different, um, frameworks of sociocracy. And there's different… people have been, you know, have different frames for what collective means. I mean.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Klaus's frame of collective is different to some of other people's. And if we don't define the terms.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Than people's negative or positive connotations to the words. Are going to get, uh… it's going to… affect the flow of the conversation. Anyway, I'll put the link in.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
For him, and if people are interested, it's 25 modules there.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And it's a course that I'm developing. Uh, for enabling people to develop their slow thinking skills.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I'm reckon I'm done speaking.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Thank you, Rick.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Yeah, I've done, um… Some work with spirodynamics, and I've been, uh, into, uh, understanding.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
This, and worked with AI, you know, to take a deep dive into.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Using spiral dynamics as a, as a communications tool. So, you can play, uh, uh, with that by taking a concept.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Um, and explaining and spinning that concept out at a high cognitive level.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And then explain that same concept. Going through the spiral, going through…

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
You know, the green, orange, red, uh, I mean, blue, red stages.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And see how the, you know, using AI, how it adapts.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
This message. To these different stages of cognition.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Um, and clearly, the story loses part of it, you know? If you are trying to explain.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:07.000
To, um… I mean, I don't mean to put any qualitative into this, but let's say.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
You go to a worker, you know, with a high school education.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And you try to explain, you know, a concept. That comes from a science perspective.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:27.000
You have to illustrate it in ways where it lives within the context of the person.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
You're communicating with. So, the same is true if you're communicating with a farmer.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:41.000
You know, the conceptual expression is stiff. Has to be adapted to that farmer.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:52.000
If you insist on keeping your language. At the level that, uh… is, you know, where, um…

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Where you are, or where someone and where you're listening to is.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Uh, and not wanting to change it, because he didn't want to lose anything. What you do is you lose the person.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:13.000
You want to communicate with, because they don't get anything. So there is a need to adapt, you know, uh, uh, to…

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:22.000
To the stages and the cognitive development of your audience. And that's coming back to Donila Meadows. I mean, that's clearly…

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:31.000
You know, what, uh, the. The pyramid of, uh… a system, what she's saying, you know, you have to adjust.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:41.000
To each stage, and speak the language of that stage in order to be heard and in order to hear as well, you know.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Um, thanks, Klaus. I think that, um. This notion of, um… the work you've done to adapt.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The messages you have to people at different levels in the.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Spiral Dynamics model is very much some sort of adaptive sense-making or something like that. You're trying to connect to different people.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Who might have different. Priorities, values, etc, etc, and so you've asked the AIs to help you.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Change the wording and the metaphors and everything done so that it might click for different audiences. It's been really, really fascinating to watch.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Uh, I appreciate that. Um… Let me ask a question that came up a little bit earlier in this call, which is.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Um, and I know that sense-making is one of the things that OGM is nominally meant to do.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Are we doing enough of it? Should we do more of it? Should we change how we do it?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I'm happy to… I did, I think, only once. I don't think I did this twice. Maybe I did it two… Two calls, but I challenge people to show up with their own sense-making tools, and we talked about something for 20 minutes, and then we compared notes on how we had made sense of.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
The conversation with, you know, are people screen-sharing their own note-taking and so forth.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Um, I… I… could have gone back and done that a dozen times and seen if we got really good at it, or if we developed some practices out of it.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I'm interested in those kinds of things. I'm… I'm very pleased that this call got a lot of interest from y'all, that people I haven't seen in a while showed up.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
That's great. Um, but what do you think? Jill.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Um, I think I'm not interested in it. Um, for the reasons that I asked at the top of the call, uh, after…

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
83 minutes of this. I still don't know what we mean by sense.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And what we mean by sense-making. And I think what we're meaning by sense-making is coming to common interpretations about things.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Which is, you know, maybe a useful thing to do, but maybe not. Again, the B deviance.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Uh, and Ken's recent comment about how. How narrow the scope of this community is.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Raises the question of what, you know, what's the value of sense-making if our, if our senses and our experience and our perceptions.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Are so undiverse, if that's the word. How can we make sense of the world that we're in with such a narrow experience of the world that we're in?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And I don't think I saw Ken say that, so… That's news to me. Um…

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Ah, thank you. There was so much chat that, yeah. Yeah.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:33.000
There's a lot of chat, couple minutes back. Um, so with the observation, with the exception of Stacy, everyone on this call is male, all are white, all are highly educated, I think all are over 45.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And all of us use… And I'll embedded in and acculturated to the social norms of the Global North. So the sense-making that is taking place here is lacking the diversity of gender, ethnicity, and Global South experiences.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And thinking this is a tiny sample to explore sense-making with.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And thanks for reading that into the recording, I appreciate that as well.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So… you know, I think it's an important observation, and it goes to my question about… I…

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And I don't mean to be the wise guy saying this, Jerry, I mean, it's really true to me in the moment, because it's a kind of sense-making that I'm doing.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
That I don't know what we're trying to do here.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Which is a question maybe for next week. And I don't want to… the last… Yeah.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000
No, I don't mean… I don't mean what we're trying to do with OGM in general. I love what we're doing with OGM in general, whatever the hell it is, and I keep coming back to this, and I'm pruning.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Okay.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
My Zoom groups, my calendar, and this one stays. So that's clear. The, the, uh…

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Sweet.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Let me tongue-in-cheek call it this obsession with sense-making. I don't understand that. And I put in the chat a conversation that Ken and I hosted, uh, two years ago.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Oh, okay.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Called Stop Making Sense Making. I invite people to have a look.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
With homage, of course, to David Byrne.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Um, thanks. And we… exactly. We have a couple people in the queue, and then possibly a phone from Ken, so we're near the end of our call time. Scott?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I got the sense…

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:17.000
You, uh, lowered your hand, but you didn't unmute. And whenever you… whenever we unmute, if you can keep your hand up while you're talking, that keeps you up in the top near the camera for me, which I like a lot.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Because the moment you unpin, you go somewhere randomly into my grid, and now I've got to hunt for you, and often you're down below, like, Scott, you're down near the bottom of my screen now. So, just as a going forward, if you want to keep your hand up while you… after you unmute, that would be super and great. Go ahead, Scott.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Awesome. Um, I got the sense that, like many of our calls, this… the topic of sense mating.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Making went to a meta level. It was not actually about making sense.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:51.000
It was about talking about what sense-making was, which I feel is more… Universal, then, our individual experiences of making sense. So, when I read.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Ken's comment, I think. I absolutely agree with that, with the sense that it's being made.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:07.000
But with the topic of what is collective sense-making and what is.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Thanks, Scott. Great.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Yeah, just a quick couple of things. One is, you know, there is the Gray Swan Guild that many of you probably know for sense-making.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:28.000
There's also the Institute of General Semantics as well. And this… so where I… I would overlap with some of Gil's concerns is that.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Um, you know, you have these academic disciplines, and they go into great depth in defining them.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But they're only one lens. And I think it does help to at least start off with a definition of whatever it is we're talking about.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:54.000
So that I can understand the differences and similarities between. How people are framing sense-making, whether it's at a practical level or at a meta level.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And I think having that as a grounding, at least then you can.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Critique the… you can say where you differ with the definition, then you can understand where the differences lie, so…

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Um, thanks, and I could have begun with a couple definitions, and it might have helped you and Gil, and so forth, so good point.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Thank you. Marc Antoine, was that you with your hand raised? It just went down accidentally?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yes, that was an accident, apologies. It is fascinating how we're…

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Go for it.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Always arguing about words, because we're always arguing with words. It's a bit… it comes with the territory. That's language for you.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Um… I… don't understand… personally killed, sorry, I don't understand your frustration with what do we mean by sense, and what do we mean by sense-making, in the sense that.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000
We're busy negotiating it. And negotiating shared meaning.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
So that we can. Have connection at all?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Have communication at all, have shared community, and maybe even act on it at some point.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And learn the praxis of. Uh… thinking with others.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Because for me, it's an essential praxis. Like, of learning to listen, learning to see the other perspectives.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And I don't expect. A formal definition of sense-making to emerge or be agreed on.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000
What I do think is… We're here because we have some shared goals.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:41.000
And having some kinds of agreement. Or some kinds of negotiating meaning, and under… and…

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Negotiating understanding is part of it. I choose to call that sense-making. That.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Wordaw is obviously offended some of us. Because they probably attach different meaning to the word, or different connotations.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
That's normal. That's always going to happen. We'll always have.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Uh… dissent. Over what does the word mean? And this is why I'm saying shared consensus is terrible.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:15.000
The illusion of consensus is terrible. We think we mean the same thing by the same word. We don't. We had a little… argument about what do we mean by prediction?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And we had different… definitions of prediction. Uh, it's fine. Um…

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And… but… It is very useful.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:33.000
To… and there, I salute your effort, Gil. To step back. What are we trying to accomplish?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But the reality is, again, there won't be a… definitive answer. We are each coming with our agenda. We're trying to find.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Identify what we're trying to. Accomplish in common.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:56.000
From our… existing individualized agenda is that there's no such thing as an individual. Not totally true. But all our individual agendas come from a history of.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Collective negotiation, also. I don't expect us to ever agree on a final definition.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
But I do think it's important to. Work on the definition progress to see.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:20.000
To explore where the agreement lies. Over. It's about how much do we want to use words? How much do we want to rely on words?

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Thanks, Marc Antoine. Someday we should have a call without words. I think that'd be pretty cool.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Especially if I could do it with miming.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Yeah, yeah, I think we'll do the Marcel Marceau, um… Paul, and everybody needs to come in whiteface and just mind what we say.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
So…

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And the musicians will do a jazz improv.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Well, we did have… we did have… we did have a… Yeah, we did have a chat and chat about jazz, which is not words, but it's communication, and perhaps sense-making.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I want to build on what Marc Antoine was saying, actually. Go ahead, Gil.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Oh, totally. Let's go back to Ken.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Without… and with… Yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Um, a few years ago, I was doing a workshop, uh, at, uh, for the National Park Service at Yosemite on conflict.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And I did not… I'm very suspicious of definitions, because if my definition's different than yours, you're going to disagree with me.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So, there were 35 people in the room, we gave everybody a stack of post-its and a marker, and said, please write down all the words and short phrases that come to mind when you think of the word conflict.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And there were over 400 responses that went up on the wall.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And we put them… had people arrange them from. The least, uh, bothersome to the most bothersome. And under the most bothersome column, someone had written organ failure.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And I said, who wrote organ failure? And so when we raised her hand and said, what does that mean? She said, that's when the conflict is so bad, I'm afraid I'm gonna have a heart attack.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I said, how many people had organ failure in your definition of conflict before? No one really asked. How many have that now? Everybody raised their hand. So.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000
To go to Marc Antoine's point, it's not about. This is the difference from sense-making and shared meaning.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:59.000
We expanded the shared meaning by allowing everyone to say, this is all the shit I think about when I think about conflict. Not trying to nail it down to a fine definition.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000
But rather, let's get it all out on the table and take a look at it and say, wow, within this group.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:19.000
This is what it means. And if we had a group 10 times the size, there'd be even more, you know? So it… becomes expansive and exponentially synthetic, synthesizing, rather than reduced down to a final definition. And I think that's a much more.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Effective way to approach something like this, where we want to get a sense of shared meaning.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Over to you, Alex.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Alex?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Do we have any more time? Because I can skip this.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Uh, go right ahead.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Okay, um, I'm… I'm just going to contribute in this following way.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Okay.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I didn't know what sense… the purpose… the purpose, not the meaning, the purpose of what we were doing here.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And I enjoy the discussion. But I could not find a thread in it, and can I just say, I'm not academic in the way that I would analyze a…

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:06.000
The pros and know what's going on. Like, whatever, you know, I'm a bit more practical. You say this, you mean that.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
So, I'm not saying what you're doing is wrong, I'm just saying that's what I'm like.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:17.000
So, listening to everything else. I was not able to say… I cannot say…

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:27.000
What it is you guys were actually… Yeah, you discuss things, you discuss sense, you discuss mate, but I don't know what the outcome, because that's the way I'm oriented.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Not because you did anything wrong. It's just, I'm oriented to solutionizing.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And there were no solutions here that I could see. It was just discussion about.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Two words, sense, making, and sometimes sense-making as a third. And I'm not saying this to complain, and I'm happy that.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I was here. But I didn't identify with then… with it, other than a set of people.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Talking about what they think. Above those three words and the combination of it.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It's not bad, you know, I'm okay, but… but… For a while, I was lost. I thought, what are we trying to do here? Because I thought there was an objective, but obviously there isn't.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
It's a discussion, and I accept that. I don't have a problem with it.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:17.000
But I just thought I'd let you know that. We're not all the same.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Absolutely. Now, Alex, thank you for that, and we didn't even get to whether sense-making should have a hyphen or not. I mean, we didn't even touch that, which.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Clearly would have sparked another… but… Thank you. I think that… I think between what Ken said and what you just said, those are really nice and different.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Bose to put on the conversation. Ken, hast thou a poem?

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I do. This one's called a note passed to Superman by Lucille Clifton.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Sweet Jesus, Superman! If I'd seen you, dressed in your blue suit, I would have known you.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Maybe that choir boy Clark can stand around listening to stories, but not you.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Not with Metropolis to save. And every crook in town filthy with kryptonite.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Ward Man of Steel. I understand the cape, the leggings, the whole ball of wax.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You can trust me, there is no planet stranger than the one I'm from.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Beautiful. Beautiful, thank you.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And that made perfect sense to everyone in the same way.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Right? With that… Oh, please.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Can I introduce something just quickly? Last week's poem, last week's poem, was brilliant. It touched me. I thought it was the most.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
One of the most brilliant poems. I sent it to my wife and kids.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000
My kid said, great poem. My wife… my wife said, that's not a perm.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Hmm.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Wow.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Then it did its job. Then it did its job.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Can we define poem?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Hey, can we define good poem? Oh…

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:11.000
At this point, I wish I had some outro music that was the Twilight Zone closing, but uh… Here we go.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Thanks, everybody. See y'all in a week!

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And someday will make sense of poetry. Or not.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Bye for now.
