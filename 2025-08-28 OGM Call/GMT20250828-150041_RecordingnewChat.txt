I heard in a lecture at the Ohio State agriculture campus that each bee with the new information can only dance for a limited time, and then they stop. Other bees then pick up one of the individual dances of the bees with new information. At some point, all the bees who are dancing are doing the same dance, and the decision is made.

I confess to being a bit baffled by “sensemaking.” Somehow the term has only made itself know to me recently, and now I can’t not see it anywhere! So I’m doing [a little homework in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking)…and can’t that I’ve made much sense of it yet. ;-) [[2021-07-27]]

**Sensemaking** or **sense-making** is the process by which people give [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics "Semantics") to their collective experiences. It has been defined as *"the ongoing retrospective development of plausible images that rationalize what people are doing"*

Gil, ah great quote. It does show it's not rational prediction. But saying that, given these notes, the next note will make it sound "good" is also a form of prediction!

@Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach And choosing that next trumpet note that makes that wrong note make sense is only possible if you have a mental model of what interval(s) will sound like. The same mental models inform that the note is “wrong” in the first place.

Again, Ken, I agree it's not a rational process. I agree there's a narrow meaning of prediction that does not fit that jazz process. With Scott, I'm using the word prediction in a broader sense that encompasses emergence, 'tis all. (I'm a big Jazz fan, btw.)

01:22:31	Eric Rangell:	for younger generations appeals to logic usually fail
01:22:52	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Did they work for older generations?
01:23:00	Mike Nelson:	Did everyone see the brilliant special section of yesterday’s Wall Street Journal about the changing culture of Silicon Valley? The article on Lighthaven and the Rationalists was particularly fascinating. https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/dynamic/render?isViewInBrowser=true&paid_regi=1&productCode=NN&sendId=203214&uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fd3b398e4-3a8a-5a96-9827-ca32b43ae4fc
01:23:21	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area:	An observation: with the exception of Stacey, everyone else on this call is male, all are white, are all highly educated, I think all are over 45,  and all of use embedded in and acculturated to the social norms of the Global North. So, the sense making that is taking place here is lacking diversity of gender, ethnicity, and Global South experiences and thinking. This is a tiny sample to explore sense making with…

Seriously: I think it was always a small percentage of people who developed the skill for slow thinking. But earlier media were better at highlighting those people as a group. In a social media world, their voice is drowned.

I think culture is a shared mental model. Ideally, that model in an organization is simple and clear and somewhat adaptable enough that it can result in coordinated actions. Tough but critical job for a leader.

01:25:45	Marc-Antoine Parent:	I think that we have been very much defining it for 80 minutes. I propose your problem is wanting a definitive definition rather than a progressive WIP.

Apologies to Jessie, as she is off camera, I did not see her.

01:31:09	iPhone (11):	would like to have a future session in which people demo tools/approach used by either this ( narrow ?) group  or known by  one of us and used by another group/demographic.

01:31:54	David Witzel:	has some portion of the population delegated its sensemaking to Trump? if he says it i'll defend it... (e.g.. "President Donald Trump delivered a barrage of false claims about crime in Washington, DC, during a series of Monday comments")
01:32:15	Jerry Michalski:	Replying to "has some portion of ..."

seems to be the price of MAGA membership
01:32:34	David Witzel:	Replying to "has some portion of ..."

makes sensemaking a lot easier!

01:34:25	Mike Nelson:	One ways to reconcile conflicting “truths” and “definitions” From Kurt Vonnegut: A chrono-synclastic infundibulum—from time ("chrono"), curved toward the same side in all directions ("synclastic"), and funnel ("infundibulum")—is a phenomenon which distorts usual human perceptions of space and time. Those that enter them are scattered across multiple times and places and can obtain awareness of how moments are structured and connected, in essence allowing them to perceive "the future" as understood by human beings. Because of this, the "many different ways of being right" in the universe can become aligned and "all different kinds of truths fit together".[1]
01:34:28	Mike Nelson:	It has thus been described as "a mathematical point where all opinions, no matter how contradictory, harmonized".[2] It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a "time warp".[3]
01:34:39	Rick Botelho:	We can use both and approaches

01:35:20	Marc-Antoine Parent:	So Ken, agreed but that's phase 1

01:35:46	Rick Botelho:	Phronesis — practical wisdom
01:35:57	Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach:	So by implication, sense making for you means convergence?

(Not for me ;-)
01:36:09	Mike Nelson:	I thought my IETF case study was an attempt at “solutionizing”

Yes, that was just the opening exercise to alert ppl to the wide variety of experiences in the room

I think sense making encompasses many processes, and convergence is one of them.
01:36:33	Eric Rangell:	I will have a conflict with this meeting starting in September but will listen offline and occasionally comment in Mattermost.  I have learned a lot from all of you!
01:36:45	Scott Moehring:	You said this, and I think this is what you meant.  <<< every conversation

01:37:25	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Replying to "Again: map for explo..."

But I agree it focuses on first phase... yet I would argue that it is meaningless without the implicit goal of mutual understanding (which is less convergence, but also part of it)
01:38:08	Jessie Upp DayBalancer.com:	Last week’s poem - YES 👏
01:38:27	Scott Moehring:	“And that made perfect sense to everyone, in the same way,… right?”  Excellent, Jerry!
