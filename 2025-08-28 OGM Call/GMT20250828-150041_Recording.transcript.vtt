1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
Mike Nelson: Ecumenical. I will drink anything that's good.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.879
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So how are you going to get it down from 52 to 4?

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.339
Mike Nelson: This is the challenge.

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.089
Mike Nelson: Particularly because some of the 52 are probably no longer being made.

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.790
Mike Nelson: Or I can only sample them at the monastery.

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.209
Mike Nelson: But it's a good, you know, it's good to have a passion and a lifetime goal.

7
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.530
Jerry Michalski: Exactly.

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.350
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Mike, do you have to become a monk? Are there beers that the monastery will only give to residents and not to visitors?

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.509
Mike Nelson: It used to be that way, I'm sure.

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.190
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.259
Mike Nelson: There still are a few that you have to go to the monastery to buy.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.409
Jerry Michalski: Well, this is….

14
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.810
Mike Nelson: going commercial.

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.489
Jerry Michalski: This is the beer-oriented start of the Open Global Mind Community Call for Thursday, August 28th.

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.460
Jerry Michalski: A 2025 welcome.

17
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.640
Alex Kladitis: If anybody's interested at some point, not today, But in…

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.579
Alex Kladitis: the iPhone came out in 07, so probably talking a couple of years. When the apps became a thing. I wanted to… to write an app

19
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.210
Alex Kladitis: So I proposed a side… I had a connection to one of the biggest CIDO manufacturers here in the UK,

20
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.340
Alex Kladitis: And I put a presentation together for an app.

21
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.649
Alex Kladitis: To allow, obviously, the brewery, let's call it, to connect to the people.

22
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.699
Alex Kladitis: but also had a whole load of features that were actually, I thought, quite interesting. They never went for it. I don't think anybody's ever written it, but I would fancy…

23
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.019
Alex Kladitis: It'd still be a pretty good one.

24
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.830
Mike Nelson: Untapped will allow you to rank the ciders that you drink as well, and they have…

25
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.729
Mike Nelson: Information on them, but the great thing about the app is you never have to drink substandard beer.

26
00:01:49.870 --> 00:02:00.279
Mike Nelson: You show up at a bar in Nicaragua or Sri Lanka, and you can kind of go through the beer list and determine which ones are, you know, at least a 3.7.

27
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.069
Jerry Michalski: They should add a little feature where you can take a picture of the menu, and it'll just overlay the untapped ratings for you.

28
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.889
Mike Nelson: Huh.

29
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.549
Mike Nelson: Well, Vivino does that for wine, so you take

30
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.130
Mike Nelson: Sure, you take a picture of the label, and it automatically pulls up the vineyard, and the year, and…

31
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.580
Mike Nelson: It's… it's pretty cool. It's not.

32
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.609
Jerry Michalski: This one's been smart.

33
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.669
Mike Nelson: though, because beer is more fun than wine.

34
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:39.320
Jerry Michalski: Well, we are, all about sense-making on today's call, and this is sense-making about, bacteria created…

35
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.300
Jerry Michalski: Beverages that we love.

36
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.929
Jerry Michalski: … And, so it's, it's, it's interesting, I'm, I'm…

37
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.400
Jerry Michalski: nominally, one of the reasons OGM even exists is as an exercise in or an exploration.

38
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.190
Doug Breitbart: bots?

39
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.020
Jerry Michalski: Oops.

40
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.430
Doug Breitbart: the WeatherTech mats.

41
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.540
Jerry Michalski: Doug, I just muted you. Oh, except you just unmuted you. There we go.

42
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.290
Jerry Michalski: Good. So nominally, we're exploring the space of sense-making, and And…

43
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:19.340
Jerry Michalski: Sometimes we're doing some sense-making, sometimes we're just doing a salon, I'm not exactly sure, but I want to kind of explore that space, and I think several of you have strong feelings in different directions, so I'd love to bring those into

44
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:30.240
Jerry Michalski: the conversation, but I wanted to start with, your frustrations around sense-making. Just, let's do a little talk just around frustrations.

45
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.270
Jerry Michalski: Around sense-making.

46
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.429
Jerry Michalski: Which could include, it's impossible.

47
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.929
Jerry Michalski: I mean, it could easily include that. John, please, you first.

48
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.110
John Kelly: Okay, let me get… get unmuted here, just a second.

49
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.169
Jerry Michalski: Sweet, we hear you fine. Oh, you can hear me? Okay, great. Yes, yes.

50
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.560
John Kelly: Well, you know, when… on the one hand, at the positive extreme, there is this….

51
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.820
Jerry Michalski: It's glorious….

52
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:07.849
John Kelly: Situation that can happen when people who trust each other, you know, maybe not 100%, but 90%, and don't exactly

53
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:27.560
John Kelly: know what they're talking about, or agree, but kind of discover, hey, wait a minute, your idea is missing this and this and this, and my idea is… you know, and then you basically, you see something that neither one of you saw, or no one in the group saw ahead of time, and you say, wow, we… because we're together, we can put this together.

54
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:45.910
John Kelly: And it is… it's not a complete solution, but it's something novel none of us thought of, and it's… it's a pointer, it's a… it's a sign that says, hey, hey, go over here, go look in this direction, this is something you ought to check out. And so that's the positive. And when that happens, wow, you know, you say.

55
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.829
John Kelly: it might all be worth it. But the other extreme, which is where we spend much more of our time, is…

56
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.419
John Kelly: Hey, you know, we, like, 95% agree, but somehow we can only come up with this little tiny 5%

57
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.750
John Kelly: Little… not, you know…

58
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:15.039
John Kelly: motherhood statement that we agree on, and it's, like, so limited. It's like, well, wait a minute, is that all we can come up with? Well, you know, objections to everything else, you know. And, …

59
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.509
John Kelly: You know, there's a little inroad being made by AI, because it can look at the statements.

60
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:41.200
John Kelly: that we're making, and say, yeah, you thought you were really far apart, but actually there's a theme here that you're not seeing, which is… which is… connects you. So that's a possibility, but those are the… those are what I see as the continuum, you know, the… the great breakthrough when you… which is the reason why people collaborate with people, even with people they don't like.

61
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.049
John Kelly: And then at the other extreme is where we spend most of our time, where we kind of agree, but

62
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.919
John Kelly: We can only come out with a motherhood statement.

63
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.199
Jerry Michalski: Great, thanks, John. Marc Antoine.

64
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.819
Marc-Antoine Parent: Yeah, well, first, absolutely true. I mean, the…

65
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.460
Marc-Antoine Parent: The point of collective intelligence to me, let me start with collective intelligence, then I'll get into sense-making.

66
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.790
Marc-Antoine Parent: is…

67
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:17.239
Marc-Antoine Parent: the diversity of perspectives, like, the world is more complex than any one person can understand, so you need the diversity of perspectives to understand

68
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.440
Marc-Antoine Parent: The world, including other people who have

69
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.610
Marc-Antoine Parent: Which are part of that complexity.

70
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.189
Marc-Antoine Parent: And, the difficulty of

71
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:45.069
Marc-Antoine Parent: reaching consensus, and it's well known, you know, start with divergence and then come to convergence. And I think so much time and sense-making is spent in exploration, and that's absolutely necessary. You cannot converge if you haven't explored and negotiated and spent the time to

72
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.130
Marc-Antoine Parent: empathize with the other standpoint and to fully understand it. And, at some point.

73
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.630
Marc-Antoine Parent: There needs to be a process where you say, okay, let's see…

74
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.530
Marc-Antoine Parent: Can we make anything out of that?

75
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:07.499
Marc-Antoine Parent: That either we all agree on, or that some of us can agree to work with. Sometimes that's enough, right?

76
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:22.130
Marc-Antoine Parent: If people… if some people say, okay, we can bring this forward, like, for me, collective intelligence, which I've distinguished squarely from crowdsourcing, which is, you know, this aggregation without iteration, and collective intelligence, iteration has to be part of it.

77
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:40.820
Marc-Antoine Parent: and improving on one another's ideas, and that's, again, takes time. But being able to be strict about, let's go from this big map-making, which is important, to decision making. You know, I once was with

78
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:51.819
Marc-Antoine Parent: committee that defined, or… Simon Buckingham should proposed a definition of collective intelligence as, Collective sensing, collective sense-making, collective…

79
00:07:51.980 --> 00:08:04.620
Marc-Antoine Parent: ideation, collective decision, collective action, and then you loop on that. I think those are all important. But to go to the… from the ideation to decision, you need to be able to

80
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:12.170
Marc-Antoine Parent: Pick out elements of the map, and decide, okay, we'll focus on this, we'll agree on that, this is out of scope, and this is a…

81
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.920
Marc-Antoine Parent: This is only possible if you have a goal.

82
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:27.620
Marc-Antoine Parent: It's nice to map, but if you… unless… and sometimes you don't have a common goal to start with, but if people have a goal, and then negotiating the goal may be part of the process, but.

83
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.150
Mike Nelson: At some point, you have to say.

84
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:39.519
Marc-Antoine Parent: We're not just trying to sense-make, though that's important, we're also trying to say, what do we do out of this? And the reality is a lot of sense-making also happens

85
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:47.200
Marc-Antoine Parent: In practice, in working together, in living the action together, because it's the iteration, that's the learning.

86
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.490
Marc-Antoine Parent: And it's the learning that's the sense-making. Over.

87
00:08:51.490 --> 00:09:00.280
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Marc Anton. And I want to gently herd us toward the frustrations we have with this, not to go defining the space yet.

88
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:15.689
Jerry Michalski: And talking about the deeper issues, because I know we have a lot of people who have really great ideas about what this is. Just, can we stay on the frustrations? Like, what's frustrating about sense-making, whether it's individual or collective, or anything like that? Mike, please.

89
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:24.030
Jerry Michalski: I'm gonna go right to that by building on what Marc Antoine just said. Perfect. In addition to having a goal.

90
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:32.350
Mike Nelson: You really desperately need a deadline, or some higher power that is pushing people

91
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:48.339
Mike Nelson: towards some kind of consensus. A lot of my negotiating experience, or at least my most frustrating negotiating experiences, have been negotiating over legislation in the U.S. Congress.

92
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:58.660
Mike Nelson: And worse, negotiation about various policy statements and conferences at the United Nations.

93
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:09.670
Mike Nelson: For instance, I was on the organizing committee for the Internet Governance Forum, and that was actually about as good as it gets in the UN system.

94
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:19.509
Mike Nelson: Because there was a deadline. You were going to have a conference on a certain day, in a certain place, and you had to put a schedule together, and you had to get speakers.

95
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.890
Mike Nelson: In contrast, there's something called the World Summit on the Information Society.

96
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:32.679
Mike Nelson: This was first held more than 20 years ago in, Geneva and then in Tunis.

97
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:38.670
Mike Nelson: And they were going to, you know, kind of scope out what the UN's role was in the…

98
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.430
Mike Nelson: digital future.

99
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:56.160
Mike Nelson: And unfortunately, there wasn't a common goal. I mean, we sort of pretended there was a common goal, which was to develop some principles that, you know, would apply in cyberspace. The U.S. was basically saying what applies

100
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.349
Mike Nelson: in real space applies in cyberspace, things like human rights.

101
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:07.889
Mike Nelson: But the Chinese had a different goal. Their goal was to water down the famous UN

102
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:16.540
Mike Nelson: Human Rights Declaration from the 40s. Other people were there because they liked going to meetings.

103
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.730
Mike Nelson: And particularly the guy from Tehran and from Syria, I mean.

104
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.090
Mike Nelson: These meetings meant a whole week, expense paid in Geneva.

105
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.330
Kevin Jones: Hmm.

106
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.929
Mike Nelson: We were supposed to have 3 meetings.

107
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.140
Mike Nelson: These guys made sure we had 5 meetings.

108
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.699
Mike Nelson: By just constantly throwing up objections.

109
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.210
Mike Nelson: And that leads to my conclusion about the largest frustration.

110
00:11:43.350 --> 00:12:03.319
Mike Nelson: And I think Marc Antoine referred to this, and that is that you need complete consensus. You know, nobody objects. Well, that doesn't work. I mean, it allows one or two people to torque the whole process and hold everybody else hostage, and that just kept happening in these UN meetings.

111
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:11.109
Mike Nelson: … So instead, I recommend what the Internet Engineering Task Force does.

112
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.909
Mike Nelson: Which is rough consensus and running code.

113
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:25.769
Mike Nelson: And so when they develop a standard, in order to assess whether all the people in the room are on the same page.

114
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.670
Mike Nelson: They hum.

115
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.279
Mike Nelson: And so, if somebody has put forward a proposal, they will then

116
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.270
Mike Nelson: Let the room… after discussion, they will let the room hum.

117
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.800
Mike Nelson: And if there is an overwhelmingly loud hum.

118
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.239
Mike Nelson: And just a minor dissenting hum.

119
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.540
Mike Nelson: That's rough consensus.

120
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:54.810
Mike Nelson: And the test, then, is does it work? And so, usually, in order to get support and to get people to hum with you.

121
00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:10.979
Mike Nelson: you have to show that this actually works, and works with other standards that the IETF has done. So that's sort of my ideal of sense-making, and I'm biased, I'm a techie geek, I spent many years at IBM and elsewhere involved in the IETF.

122
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.170
Mike Nelson: But the reason they hum is because people might show up

123
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.299
Mike Nelson: wearing a Cisco badge, or an IBM hat.

124
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.540
Mike Nelson: And, the corporate position might be different than theirs.

125
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.500
Mike Nelson: But as an engineer, they hum for the best technical solution, even if it doesn't.

126
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.219
Mike Nelson: help their company. And humming gives them anonymity.

127
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.589
Mike Nelson: Long talk, but hope that's helpful.

128
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:51.150
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Mike. And, we're drifting again into solutions and what seems to work, as opposed to just frustrations. If I can keep us on frustrations for just a wee bit longer, until we've, like, put a couple good ones on the table, there's a couple good ones showing up in the chat.

129
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:57.330
Jerry Michalski: I think Eric was talking about, lack of shared context due to filter bubbles. That's a great frustration.

130
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.660
Jerry Michalski: Guilt, please.

131
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.079
Mike Nelson: If I can add one more, and that is just…

132
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.550
Mike Nelson: pervasive disinformation. You waste a lot of time trying to fix that problem.

133
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:12.479
Jerry Michalski: So when there's… when there's people actively trying to make sure that cents can't be made, that's a… that's a biggie. Yep.

134
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.819
Jerry Michalski: Guilt.

135
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.160
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yep. … I love the humming, Mike, thank you for that.

136
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:30.509
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: even if it maybe is a solution. Your discussion of the people who wanted the meetings to go on longer because there were expenses paid reminds me of the COP, the Conference on the Parties Around Climate, which is coming up in Bellam.

137
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:38.610
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: In Brazil, shortly, where there will be 600 actual decision-forming delegates and 100,000 other people.

138
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:51.680
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: overwhelming the city of Belle M, many of whom are there on expense accounts and happy to be there for whatever purpose. So, frustrations… so I'm frustrated with this conversation.

139
00:14:52.880 --> 00:15:01.460
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I put a comment in the chat that I thought might be seen as flippant, but it was really serious, which is, I'm not clear what we mean by sense.

140
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.379
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: that we are making… that we are sense-making about. I'm not clear what we mean by sense. Does sense mean…

141
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:20.849
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Coming to an interpretation of, quote, reality that is somehow satisfying to me or furthers my expectations or cares or concerns. Does sense-making mean coming to some kind of shared interpretation about something?

142
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:39.000
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Does it mean coming to shared commitment to action, consent, you know, decisions around coordination? Most of the conversation so far seems to have been about goals and decision-making, which I would suggest is a… is a subset of sense-making, and one that,

143
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.339
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Hmm.

144
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:59.589
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, I understand why people said that's critical. It also gets… can get in the way of sense-making. Premature attention to goals implies a tacit sense-making that has already happened, maybe has not been spoken.

145
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.629
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So I'm gonna echo what Eric said about context being really important.

146
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.770
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: …

147
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:14.479
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But the fundamental question is not at all clear to me, so I'm frustrated that we're talking about sense-making with no idea or even sense of what we mean by sense.

148
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.409
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I like that. Ben, I'll stop there. Frustrating enough for you, Jerry?

149
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:35.990
Jerry Michalski: That's good, that's good. And I'm surprised that nobody yet has talked about how little sense we might have made over time in OGM. I thought that would pop up pretty early, because I'm a little frustrated by that.

150
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.729
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, what do you mean by… what do you mean by cents, Jerry?

151
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:50.280
Jerry Michalski: I think… I think we've had a very nice series of salon conversations that occasionally connect people, that occasionally put ideas we haven't heard of on the table, but we haven't done much sense-making.

152
00:16:50.650 --> 00:17:04.279
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: What do you mean by sense-making? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be… I don't mean to be an ass here, but I'm… I really… I don't know what you mean by sense, or sense-making, or what you're frustrated about, and I don't come to OGM for sense-making, so carry on.

153
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:19.060
Jerry Michalski: And if you'll give me a moment, I'm trying to head there. Okay. So I was first going to do a round of what are our frustrations with sense-making, and see what shows up, you know, what we put on the table. Then I was going to ask, what is evidence that sense-making has happened?

154
00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:25.729
Jerry Michalski: What tells you individually, just personally, that some sense-making happened

155
00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:44.209
Jerry Michalski: or, you know, when you show up somewhere, when you look at something, when you see an artifact, and you're like, oh, oh, oh, that's really good sense-making, and I'm sure this is going to be pretty particular to each of us, like, we'll have different opinions, but I'm very interested in what means sense-making happen? What are the remainders? What is the evidence of it?

156
00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:46.679
Jerry Michalski: And I was gonna head from there back into…

157
00:17:46.719 --> 00:17:54.029
Jerry Michalski: You know, what might we do about it, and how do we operate, and all those kinds of things, but we're sort of jumping straight in there. But Gil, I appreciate your.

158
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.729
Mike Nelson: You're being very hard on yourself. I think you and I both…

159
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:05.410
Mike Nelson: think sense-making is something that is documented in a document. It slides, it's a report.

160
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:05.870
Jerry Michalski: Not always.

161
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:12.450
Mike Nelson: AM has not written things, but all of us, several of us, have used the wisdom of this crowd.

162
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:19.890
Mike Nelson: to write some very good stuff. So I think you… you need to look at the broader ecosystem that you've engendered.

163
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.780
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, and I really appreciate that. Let me go to the queue.

164
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:33.619
Jerry Michalski: And see what y'all think. But that's kind of where he was heading, with the discussion, because I want to address skills issue, but I think we can't

165
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.459
Jerry Michalski: get there, like, immediately, directly, until we've talked about some of these other things. Doug?

166
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:51.169
Doug Breitbart: So… My biggest, frustration sidestepping the issue of what you mean by sense-making and Gil's issue.

167
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:58.439
Doug Breitbart: … Is that this always starts at Chapter 3 or 4.

168
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.239
Doug Breitbart: And it doesn't really contend with…

169
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.690
Doug Breitbart: The fundamental ingredients at play.

170
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:17.720
Doug Breitbart: So… First of all, anything modified by the word collective in front of it, Is a major annoyance.

171
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.469
Doug Breitbart: For me, frustration for me, because the minute you start…

172
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:29.039
Doug Breitbart: voicing collective. It's sort of like, use of the word we by somebody speaking.

173
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.339
Doug Breitbart: You posit this aggregate thing that doesn't really exist.

174
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:43.519
Doug Breitbart: And then you set up the BTEXT for a general feeling of failure.

175
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:51.179
Doug Breitbart: Because it doesn't really exist, but it's… it becomes this sort of conceptualized ideal.

176
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:56.800
Doug Breitbart: And… but the we, which also doesn't exist, never arrives there.

177
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.060
Doug Breitbart: So it's sort of like, out of the box, let's set up a premise for failure.

178
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:14.140
Doug Breitbart: And then, you know, do the mosh pit metaphoric, you know, cockfighting as to who wins and who's right. So, just to sort of, like.

179
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.869
Doug Breitbart: You know, raise the fundamentals.

180
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:23.269
Doug Breitbart: When that happens, what it also does… is… it… it…

181
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:29.609
Doug Breitbart: Implicitly zeroes out and negates the concept of inclusion.

182
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.890
Doug Breitbart: Indigates the concept of individual agency.

183
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:53.300
Doug Breitbart: And it… it… Turns things into consensus, slash collective agreement Or alignment around a proposition, Rather than…

184
00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:02.460
Doug Breitbart: The concept of arriving at Consent by all individuals involved.

185
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:09.880
Doug Breitbart: To whatever a conclusory proposition or action or intention is.

186
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:19.260
Doug Breitbart: And to arrive at consent, Means creating the generosity in the space.

187
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:25.500
Doug Breitbart: For all voices to be heard, for all turbulence or triggers to be processed and handled.

188
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:34.160
Doug Breitbart: And for people to arrive at a place where there is a general shared understanding that

189
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:43.090
Doug Breitbart: of the same it at the center that's being discussed or wrestled to ground. And… …

190
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.830
Doug Breitbart: 99% of the conversations, interactions, and…

191
00:21:51.020 --> 00:22:00.759
Doug Breitbart: and gatherings like this that I experience, … do that.

192
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.950
Doug Breitbart: And it's a major frustration, because…

193
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.539
Doug Breitbart: The essentials of listening, of receiving.

194
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.709
Doug Breitbart: Of, respecting, appreciating, and supporting

195
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:25.740
Doug Breitbart: individuals in co-creating together, and… and co… co… … Formulating together and synthesizing together, Follow me.

196
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:37.540
Doug Breitbart: are considered… Not relevant, and not allowable in the name of efficiency and getting to a result.

197
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.220
Doug Breitbart: Like, we can't do that.

198
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.690
Doug Breitbart: Because it'll take too long.

199
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.230
Doug Breitbart: We'll never get to an output or a product, and with that, I'm complete.

200
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.210
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Doug. It feels like you've put a whole bunch of fish on the table.

201
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:06.589
Jerry Michalski: that I can't quite distinguish from the others, some of which I disagree with. Like, I think collective intelligence is not a melapropism, or a misnomer, or a…

202
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.900
Jerry Michalski: Whatever. I think that it's actually…

203
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.889
Jerry Michalski: possible, and I put in the chat, Quaker sense of the meeting.

204
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:32.900
Jerry Michalski: which is a method that Quakers use to discuss issues, and then there's the clerk, which is a randomly assigned position, will say, I think we have sense of the meeting at some point, when not necessarily everybody has been heard from, but there's just… and they will report back what they think the meeting holds at that moment, and Quakers

205
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.680
Jerry Michalski: We use that as decision-making. Quakers don't believe in oath-taking or voting.

206
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:52.869
Jerry Michalski: Which makes it, you know, harder in normal democratic or group function, we're like, oh, we'll just all put dot voting or something, and dot voting on ideas is, I've seen, kill more good concepts in my life than I care to enumerate. And then you're also talking about

207
00:23:53.210 --> 00:24:01.880
Jerry Michalski: the pressures of time in the name of efficiency, we're gonna have to skip a whole bunch of things that we should skip, and I'm like.

208
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:14.740
Jerry Michalski: I feel like my 27 years of feeding my brain is sense-making, and I don't feel like I'm under a deadline or pressure to do it. I feel like I make it public in order to have some kind of conversations that aren't necessarily materializing.

209
00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:22.979
Jerry Michalski: I can count on one hand the people who've approached me and seem to understand what I've done with my brain, and engage me in conversations like that.

210
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:31.380
Jerry Michalski: But it's my earnest attempt to do that, and I do that every single day. But it's a slow process that metabolizes

211
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.070
Jerry Michalski: Information that connects, that links, that leaves behind an artifact.

212
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:57.730
Jerry Michalski: Which is a little bit why. I'm sort of like… Mike was like, well, we think that it's a report or a product. I'm not so sure. I think sense-making can just be an agreement or a sense that something happened, or if anybody's heard the name, the word senius, it's the idea that there can be a group of people that achieve something really special, and they have a sense of genius, of genius that happened in that scene, in that space.

213
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:09.319
Jerry Michalski: I think that's interesting, and that might be a form of sense-making, too, I think. And here I'm thinking maybe my sense of sense-making is very broad, and might be broader than most of us on the call, I don't know.

214
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:16.200
Jerry Michalski: But, … But, you know, maybe a hive of bees is sense-making where the…

215
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:35.440
Jerry Michalski: food gradient is going to send them next, and, like, which of the little pods to feed to make the next queen, kind of thing. That's a form of collective sense-making, and if you read Kropotkin, the scary anarchist, he's busy studying how nature comes to decisions that work out pretty well. I'm like, that's really cool, sounds like sense-making to me.

216
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:41.120
Jerry Michalski: With no conversation going on, right? Or, or some other forms of communication. Anyway…

217
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:47.570
Jerry Michalski: And Gil has something about bees. Is it a problem with bees, or is it, bee sting that you want to report in?

218
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:53.910
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Oh, no, it's an insight about bees I just learned the other day, and someday tell me why you call Kerpotkin scary, but that's for another time.

219
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.459
Jerry Michalski: Oh, that was totally irony. That was totally irony.

220
00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:01.519
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Thank you, okay. Yeah. Because I'm a big fan. Me too.

221
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.140
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So people know about the B dance.

222
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.840
Jerry Michalski: We wiggle, waggle.

223
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:22.329
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: the bee waggle. Bees go out and find places where there's pollen and come back to the hive and do what's called a dance, or a waggling that is, huh, sense-making, or certainly communication of information about where the food is, and efficiently guides the hive

224
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:32.320
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: the worker bees in the hive to go find the food and bring stuff back to the colony, but it turns out that 10%, 10-20% of the bees do not do that. Do not follow the instructions.

225
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:38.419
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And it's critically important that they do that. The deviance is essential. Without it, the hive would die.

226
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.460
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, part of the sense-making process is the outliers.

227
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:53.149
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That do not accept the consensus, that go their own way, that go off the ideal, efficient, so-called optimized path, and find other stuff.

228
00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.410
Jerry Michalski: So are you suggesting that we rename Open Global Mind the Deviant Bee Laboratory?

229
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:08.340
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Well, we've got, you know, we'll fight over biological metaphors. We've got the big fungus, and we've got the bee laboratory, and we'll have to make some sense of that some other time.

230
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.630
Jerry Michalski: I like that. Thanks, Gil.

231
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.280
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Okay.

232
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.920
Jerry Michalski: Mark Antoine.

233
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:25.010
Marc-Antoine Parent: So, so much to get into. I, I was… I wanted to react to the notion that there's no such thing as collective intelligence. The, …

234
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:42.669
Marc-Antoine Parent: I'm a big fan of the work of Hugo Merci, who's basically claiming that human cognition evolved as collective cognition, not as individual cognition, and makes a solid argument that the

235
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:52.890
Marc-Antoine Parent: Cognitive biases are actually very good heuristics in a collective context, and absolutely unjustifiable in an individual cognition context.

236
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.250
Rick Botelho: No.

237
00:27:53.250 --> 00:28:10.540
Marc-Antoine Parent: Now, that said, other points were made with which I agree much more. Like, there is a danger of premature convergence. That is totally a thing. There is a danger of… and the definition of us is…

238
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:29.709
Marc-Antoine Parent: do we agree us exists? And that's always a big, big, big issue, like when I mentioned this definition of collective sensing, sense-making, and so on, but what's the collective exist… the existence of the collective is a totally… totally a presupposition. And yet.

239
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:36.309
Marc-Antoine Parent: All cognition happens in interaction. That is what I'm going to propose. There is…

240
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:46.850
Marc-Antoine Parent: Now, of course, that means the group is always being renegotiated. Who's the insider, outsider, the inclusion, and putting the emphasis on inclusion was really important. Boundaries matter.

241
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:54.090
Marc-Antoine Parent: And… That said, I said my frustration I'd put at the top of the chat was.

242
00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.240
Marc-Antoine Parent: One thing I find terrible is illusion of consensus.

243
00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:09.779
Marc-Antoine Parent: when we think we agree, and it's actually way too fuzzy to be meaningful, and to be actionable, and to be precise. That is also a problem.

244
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:22.670
Marc-Antoine Parent: And yeah, the group can be a temptation to say, oh, we all agree, and there's such a thing as groupthink, and following the group, and saying we agree, and being agreeable to the group. So that is

245
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.669
Marc-Antoine Parent: Absolutely a real risk.

246
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.819
Marc-Antoine Parent: And yes, outliers matter for that.

247
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.790
Marc-Antoine Parent: And… …hem.

248
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.889
Marc-Antoine Parent: A shared purpose is defined by the group. It's not already there, it's something that emerges from the negotiation.

249
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.910
Marc-Antoine Parent: And the groups congregate around.

250
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:47.139
Marc-Antoine Parent: A shared action, when the action emerges from all these…

251
00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.559
Marc-Antoine Parent: Yes, individual, but mostly happening in negotiation consensus.

252
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.149
Marc-Antoine Parent: And so the group is as much

253
00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:06.899
Marc-Antoine Parent: Pre-existing as the product of the negotiation of goals and meaning, shared or not, and negotiated in action.

254
00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.079
Marc-Antoine Parent: And the group is also characterized.

255
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:26.739
Marc-Antoine Parent: by a certain practice. I said, it's the action that defines the group, and it's the tradition that makes the group exist through time. It's a transmission of a certain way of doing things that makes the group exist and have a boundary.

256
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:33.509
Marc-Antoine Parent: And, … And again, it may splinter, it may evolve, it may… all kinds of things may happen.

257
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:40.380
Marc-Antoine Parent: But what defines a group? It's a shared practice, and as such, it's, again, … crystallized.

258
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:51.430
Marc-Antoine Parent: The result of a… the crystallized result of a prior sense-making, that ideally should be constantly renegotiated. Over.

259
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.450
Jerry Michalski: Thanks for your time.

260
00:30:53.730 --> 00:31:06.410
Jerry Michalski: Mr. Jones, and if you don't mind, Kevin, my external perception of your life, in some sense, if I can just riff on this at this moment, is that you are kind of on a gradient sense-making mission in your life.

261
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:22.820
Jerry Michalski: Because you keep trying to find your way to what works, and you bump into stuff, and you bump into stuff, and you're like, well, you know, you did a nice job getting out of the dot-com implosion, and then you went into philanthropy, and then you're like, well, shit, this is not working. There's all sorts

262
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.220
Jerry Michalski: assuming…

263
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:41.909
Jerry Michalski: openness philanthropy. So you created an environment where you could invite in a whole mess of people, which becomes SOCAP, and sort of explore that area, and then you leave that behind. You're like, you need to go build a new nest. But you're… I perceive you as always, like, heading toward this thing you have in your head that is sense-making, personal.

264
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.960
Jerry Michalski: About what's gonna work.

265
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:51.239
Kevin Jones: Well, interesting. Yeah, I see myself as a truffle hound, you know, I have that much to do.

266
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.609
Jerry Michalski: That's a way to say the same thing.

267
00:31:52.610 --> 00:32:01.780
Kevin Jones: Yeah, you know, I go sniff out what's next. But, you know, I've been reading a marathon of Ursula Le Guin's Hanish Cycle.

268
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:15.580
Kevin Jones: Which is about getting out of slavery. And, you know, sense-making leads to definitions, which is a great… the first tool of the colonizer is sense-making to definitions.

269
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:29.739
Kevin Jones: that validates, land grabs and saying who's an asset and who's a person. And so I think, you know, it's… which is, you know, obviously happening with ICE now and those kinds of things. And I think sense-making has been

270
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:48.619
Kevin Jones: more a tool of the conqueror than… yeah, I think it is sense-making. It totally is sense-making. It makes sense for them. No, it's… it's sense-making. Okay, I'm not going to argue with your chats. Sorry. Okay. They say, this is what is. That's what makes it happen, and this is without.

271
00:32:48.620 --> 00:33:06.530
Kevin Jones: And so, you know, there was a revolt on the planet Yao, where the women said, we are no longer assets. And the men came along, and then they said, oh, but it is a patriarchy, and they said, well, no, that won't work either. But it was… sense-making leads to the powerful having the power to define.

272
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:30.809
Kevin Jones: And, you know, if you look at all land extractions, you know, the Marshall trilogy that made Native Americans a dependent nation, that therefore their land can't be an asset, and that they can't get a mortgage on it, and they can't get intergenerational wealth, was completely like redlining that, you know, African Americans couldn't get a government mortgage after the Depression, and they couldn't get it after being

273
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.190
Kevin Jones: in World War II with the GI Bill.

274
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:36.609
Kevin Jones: So, sense-making leads to a definition of the powerless.

275
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.330
Kevin Jones: By the powerful.

276
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:50.430
Jerry Michalski: So, Kevin, that was highly unexpected from my perspective, and I'm going to refuse to let you taint the word sense-making that deeply in my head. Others may go… others may go with you on this, but I could say that speech

277
00:33:50.430 --> 00:34:08.310
Jerry Michalski: enables the powerful to have the power to define, oh my god, we should just cancel speech. We should never talk about speech, because all these people who've used speech to control us, they're just bad people, and look what effect that's happened on our lives. It's the source of all colonialism, it's the source of all bad things that have happened, and like.

278
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:13.510
Jerry Michalski: Not really. It's particular uses of sense or speech, or….

279
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:20.159
Kevin Jones: Yeah, yeah, that's a really stupid thing to have just said, okay? Because the people rose up.

280
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.830
Jerry Michalski: Sorry, Kevin, why did you say that that way?

281
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.539
Kevin Jones: I shouldn't have said it that way.

282
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.260
Jerry Michalski: Why did you say that that way, exactly?

283
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.639
Kevin Jones: because I thought it was a gross.

284
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.710
Kevin Jones: misunderstanding of what I said.

285
00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.009
Jerry Michalski: Maybe it was a provocation or something, but why did you say it that way?

286
00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:52.600
Kevin Jones: because I thought it was a gross misunderstanding of what I said, taking it to someplace where it never was and shouldn't have been, and it was so… it just rubbed me wrong, and I shouldn't have called it stupid. I should have called it.

287
00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.590
Jerry Michalski: You didn't call it stupid, you sort of called me stupid.

288
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:58.759
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Jerry, you've now asked him 4 times, he's answered 3 times.

289
00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.190
Jerry Michalski: Okay.

290
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.039
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Kind of… let's get escape velocity here.

291
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:09.169
Jerry Michalski: I did not like that intervention. I was trying to move your idea into a different spot and see what it provoked, but it certainly didn't need to provoke that.

292
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.009
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Could I try something here?

293
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:12.580
Jerry Michalski: Yes, please.

294
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.530
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: …

295
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:24.430
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Kevin, I hear what you're saying, and … but it seems that the women on whatever Le Guin's planet was, or whatever, are sense-making also. It seems that the people being colonized are sense.

296
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.780
Kevin Jones: That's great.

297
00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.700
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: also.

298
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.479
Kevin Jones: They claimed their voice.

299
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:35.980
Kevin Jones: Well, that's sense-making, too, so you're using the word in a very particular way of, you know, how sense-making is used by dominators.

300
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.730
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: As opposed to sense-making itself, I think.

301
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.149
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: That's how I'm hearing you.

302
00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:51.410
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Because we're all about… you, in fact, in speaking what you spoke, were doing a bit of sense-making. In other words, sharing an interpretation that you have formed out of your experience.

303
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.100
Kevin Jones: You know, okay.

304
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:53.540
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yep.

305
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.259
Jerry Michalski: So, let's not get stuck on this.

306
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.760
Jerry Michalski: I'm sorry… Excuse me.

307
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.370
Kevin Jones: Team is the tool of the powerful.

308
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:24.199
Jerry Michalski: Which I totally disagree with. If you read CAST by Isabel Roberson, she's like, what happens is, somebody comes in, creates an artificial distinction, reinforces that artificial distinction in a community, and that causes all kinds of shit that is how you create a colonial power structure that works. And I totally agree that that's happened over and over again. I don't think that was sense-making. I think that was redefining

309
00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:39.709
Jerry Michalski: words for everybody, and then applying value, differential value, that normally would not make sense to any of the participants in the community, but that they are forced to live under. And for me, none of that was sense-making, it was re-establishing… it was like, …

310
00:36:39.710 --> 00:37:00.549
Jerry Michalski: you know, in Taming of the Shrew, there, you know, there's the moon in the sky, and everybody's like, no, no, shit, that's the sun. It's like, oh, if we don't say that to the moon, we die. We don't get food, we don't get married, we don't get anything. So I kind of get where it goes. But to me, that's not sense-making, and we can leave… we can leave the debate on the for a second if we want. There's a bit of a queue that's been quite patient.

311
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.820
Jerry Michalski: So how about class?

312
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.149
Klaus Mager: Yeah, so, …

313
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:27.809
Klaus Mager: maybe because of my German upbringing and background, when I hear the word collective, it rings a completely different bell than what this conversation has been going on for so far, right? And then you initiated the conversation saying collective intelligence.

314
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:33.179
Klaus Mager: But somehow we morphed into sense-making, which is a completely different topic again.

315
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:42.870
Klaus Mager: And it's connected, but, you know, so collective intelligence… It really is, … …

316
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:51.909
Klaus Mager: like a mass movement, right? I mean, you… I'm thinking of herds of waves when I see collective.

317
00:37:52.280 --> 00:38:04.390
Klaus Mager: You know, you have, you have a consensus building where people maintain the same opinion, maintain a worldview that moves them into action.

318
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:15.110
Klaus Mager: And that's what we're seeing right now, right? So, particularly within the context of our current environment, our political environment.

319
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.630
Klaus Mager: …

320
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:34.560
Klaus Mager: This is… this is a pretty ominous kind of state that we are in, where collective intelligence is being manipulated, you know, to create a worldview that has people do things in groups.

321
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.490
Klaus Mager: That are… that are rather harmful.

322
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:54.070
Klaus Mager: So that's where… and I've posted a couple articles on a definition of intelligence. First of all, you know, what do we mean by intelligence from a technical perspective?

323
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.079
Klaus Mager: And then what…

324
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:13.939
Klaus Mager: what are the… what are the influences, you know, of collective? And I'm really emphasizing that the conversation should be on what is collective, not what is intelligence or sense-making, but what does it mean within the context of collective.

325
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:24.809
Klaus Mager: Right? Because that's where we are right now, and that's an extremely dangerous moment in time, and we're completely skirting the topic.

326
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:42.670
Jerry Michalski: Klaus, thank you for the warning about how collective hits you because of your background. That's super useful. And I'm… my intent with starting this call was both personal sense-making and collective, but the thing I'm most interested in is the collective part of it, like you just said.

327
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:51.870
Jerry Michalski: But I think without us on our own little sense-making quests, we don't get good collective intelligence in some sense, but I don't feel strongly about what I just said.

328
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.970
Jerry Michalski: Mr. Mooring, please.

329
00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:02.809
Jerry Michalski: who has been trying to help us make sense out of things with DSRP and other frameworks over time, and showing us his experiments, and… please!

330
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.820
Scott Moehring: Hello, everyone.

331
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:14.879
Scott Moehring: So one of my themes has been how the individuals aggregate to the group, and when we talk about collective.

332
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:23.400
Scott Moehring: there is… in a sense, collective is the aggregation, I believe, of all the individuals, and I kind of…

333
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:41.790
Scott Moehring: have been taught to think about it as a bunch of people on a beach in a giant clear plastic ball, and they're all walking inside the ball, and it's sort of, where does the ball go? Well, there might be some who are trying to go this way, but most of them are going this way, so the ball generally follows that vector.

334
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:55.210
Scott Moehring: And the reason I bring that up is that I've been thinking about why we think, which is why we make a mental model, which is our sense-making, our collective, our intelligence, if you will.

335
00:40:55.430 --> 00:41:08.019
Scott Moehring: And the conclusion I came to, and this is just kind of my own, is we want to interpret the past so we can predict the future, so we can decide and act.

336
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.920
Jerry Michalski: And so the whole reason to make sense….

337
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:20.369
Scott Moehring: Or to have a collective intelligence, is to inform Our predictions and our actions.

338
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:28.050
Scott Moehring: And I think that that's an interesting way of thinking about it for me, and I'm not sure

339
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:39.899
Scott Moehring: others will riff on this, but I just wanted to throw that out there, that that… a mental model is a prediction, and a collective intelligence, to my way of thinking, is a…

340
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:44.350
Scott Moehring: Mental model held by a collective.

341
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.200
Scott Moehring: So….

342
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.150
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Scott.

343
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.329
Jerry Michalski: Mark up front real quick?

344
00:41:51.590 --> 00:42:01.239
Marc-Antoine Parent: Ye… Absolutely agreed. Sense-making is partly a mental model, and a mental model update, but it's also

345
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:13.059
Marc-Antoine Parent: it's a storytelling, and a story, in a way, is a simplified version of the model. It's what can fit in the brain of a very complex world, and it's also about negotiating

346
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.970
Marc-Antoine Parent: shared,

347
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:29.909
Marc-Antoine Parent: sense of provenance and purpose. There's the… there's a prediction as utilitarian, let's get to a goal, and there's a prediction as a sense of being somebody, a certain kind of person, in a certain kind of group.

348
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:36.829
Marc-Antoine Parent: And that is… that is the other side of sense-making. It's a… it's also feeding identity, as well as

349
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.860
Marc-Antoine Parent: Action. Purposeful action.

350
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:39.840
Marc-Antoine Parent: Over.

351
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.470
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

352
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.810
Jerry Michalski: Doug.

353
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.539
Doug Breitbart: I sort of wanted to lose.

354
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:47.890
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: born.

355
00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.619
Doug Breitbart: And I wanted to loop back, to….

356
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.030
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Dude!

357
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.910
Doug Breitbart: The difference between censoring

358
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:07.549
Doug Breitbart: Which is a thing that I do as a human being, and other human beings do.

359
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:12.800
Doug Breitbart: Versus sense-making.

360
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:19.689
Doug Breitbart: And The di- and the shift into sense-making

361
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.949
Doug Breitbart: One man's sense is another's nonsense.

362
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:28.679
Doug Breitbart: And that was you, and that was… that was you and Kevin.

363
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:35.800
Doug Breitbart: In that moment, And the… the difference between things that are…

364
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:40.570
Doug Breitbart: That are susceptible and intrinsic to being subjective.

365
00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:49.199
Doug Breitbart: Versus… The ingredients of, of, of humans as living beings.

366
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:57.509
Doug Breitbart: and the way I experience… the way I receive and take in information.

367
00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:02.020
Doug Breitbart: the way I respond to that, and the way I respond to others.

368
00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:09.690
Doug Breitbart: … There are the… there are the sort of the ingredients and dimensions of that.

369
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:18.860
Doug Breitbart: But then there's the… transformation of All of that into beliefs.

370
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.940
Doug Breitbart: Into frameworks and protections and attachments.

371
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.170
Doug Breitbart: and constructs.

372
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.580
Doug Breitbart: Which are all products of mind.

373
00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.330
Doug Breitbart: They're not of reality, they're of mind.

374
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:48.979
Doug Breitbart: And… My… I would argue that the Quakers are, in sense, making their sensing in that meeting form.

375
00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.690
Doug Breitbart: And…

376
00:44:56.830 --> 00:45:02.800
Doug Breitbart: And I think, you know, I align with… with what Mark just shared.

377
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:05.409
Doug Breitbart: In terms of…

378
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:25.919
Doug Breitbart: understanding which is… individual, And… With others, so coming to a common understanding of whatever, fill in the blank.

379
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:39.490
Doug Breitbart: Is intrinsically, you know, … An, unevolved, evolving, and, and, and, … elaborative.

380
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:41.750
Doug Breitbart: process.

381
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.530
Rick Botelho: decide… She's a cliffhanger.

382
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:47.870
Jerry Michalski: I just needed Rick.

383
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:57.239
Doug Breitbart: You know, it is an elaborative process, and is a constantly changing one.

384
00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:08.550
Doug Breitbart: the… The illusion, delusion, like, addiction, the… Seems to prevail culturally.

385
00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:16.690
Doug Breitbart: around… Fixing understandings in a moment of time, and then playing them forward.

386
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:23.180
Doug Breitbart: And believing that they control future to be, rather than the future to be.

387
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.180
Doug Breitbart: Being the dog and us being the tail.

388
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.120
Doug Breitbart: Is… is the challenge.

389
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:42.099
Doug Breitbart: And we love our constructions, and our models, and our frameworks and our stuff, but the truth of the matter is that we don't have any control over what happens next.

390
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:47.899
Doug Breitbart: And the world we're living in is sort of a living example, but that's… the case.

391
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.760
Doug Breitbart: So, I'm complete at.

392
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:54.240
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Doug.

393
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.130
Jerry Michalski: Kevin.

394
00:46:55.430 --> 00:47:14.119
Kevin Jones: Well, again, I'll apologize for my overreaction. It just felt like you were doing violence to my idea, and I just… it was a limbic reaction. But I'm with Doug on collective and making, and I think, to me, sense-making feels like you want to come out with a toaster, when I think you should come out with a…

395
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.559
Kevin Jones: You should have sniffed a sock that leads you down a trail.

396
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:31.409
Kevin Jones: And… and so that… and the collective is… is always, you know, the group is a conspiracy against the outlier. One of the reasons I knew SOCAP would succeed is I, …

397
00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:51.419
Kevin Jones: I started going to people, should there be a conference like this? And … another guy said, you know, there were two groups. Okay, this is… this story has a point. There was a group led by TIDES, and one led by Aspen Institute, and they were trying to define this thing, and I said, I'll do a conversation map

398
00:47:51.510 --> 00:48:10.609
Kevin Jones: between them, and how they define it versus you, because nobody could agree on what to call it, and they were fighting over definitions. And then they said, oh, you know, there's only 10 minutes worth. Then they said, there's no time, and they said, well, don't you want to know what the people who are not in the room are saying? And they said, no, we think we have the right people in the room. And I said, oh.

399
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.849
Kevin Jones: What a great market opportunity!

400
00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:17.589
Kevin Jones: You know, they think… when you have the right people in the room, you have a summit.

401
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:24.989
Kevin Jones: And what we needed was a marketplace where the Byzantine and the barbarian could discover each other as unlikely allies.

402
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:43.280
Kevin Jones: Fortunately for me, they all went to good schools and had flown business class to their families' vacations, and so they were not ready for somebody to say, no, these folks that are outsiders to you need to be brought in, and we can explain why they can be unlikely allies.

403
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.879
Kevin Jones: So, you know, sense-making is not a toaster.

404
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:53.090
Jerry Michalski: There's a bumper sticker. Mike, bumper sticker, alert, sense-making is not a tester.

405
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.810
Jerry Michalski: Dave?

406
00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:13.859
David Witzel: Yeah, I mean, I think I just wanted to throw in, like, what I think of it, probably data points, but, I mean, I was, … Mark, you said something about the… in the chat, I think, about the, you know, the individual doesn't exist, and except to the individual, you know? And I do think we're kind of caught between

407
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:23.360
David Witzel: sense-making as an individual effort, you know, I'm trying to make my sense… I'm trying to make sense versus sense-making as a collective effort, which is I'm trying to make shared sense.

408
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:33.929
David Witzel: And… and the shared sense, I think, is where it's really… the idea that trying to convince people is violence is, I think, more often in the shared sense space

409
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:52.460
David Witzel: And I was struck, my wife is working at Cal, and the new students are coming on to campus this week, and she was doing an exercise where she was asking them to talk about their strengths. And she said she heard from a lot of them that they had a strength which was listening.

410
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:53.830
David Witzel: …

411
00:49:53.830 --> 00:50:15.000
David Witzel: And she thought it was interesting that that was, you know, such a prominent strength, and I asked her if anybody said their strength was debating, and nobody says that anymore. And I swear that's a… that's an era change thing, right? I mean, listening is a modern skill set. I'm pretty sure, you know, in a big chunk of, you know, CPAC and stuff, debating is still a strong force.

412
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.859
David Witzel: … But they have different effects on the sense-making, right?

413
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:36.499
David Witzel: And then the other… the other… one thing I've been going… I just came back from Vermont, and in Vermont, where we… where we go to the lake, there's this big Amish community. So you have this Amish community that has this sense of their culture, living surrounded by this Vermont, you know, traditional white kind of

414
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:41.530
David Witzel: whatever Vermont community is. And they're quite distinct, but they're still…

415
00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:57.969
David Witzel: coherent, right? So, they have two very different senses, but they both work, you know? So I think this notion of an ultimate sense is probably a flawed notion, right? There's… there's many of them out there, you know, it's kind of enough cooperation or something that you can… you don't end up killing each other.

416
00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:03.380
David Witzel: And then maybe the last data point was just one. I was listening to the Zach Bush,

417
00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:21.449
David Witzel: interview yesterday, trying to figure out what he means, and he… one of these observations was that… that… that we don't have to worry about AI, because AI will never be able to understand the way humans do, because AI has been trained on words.

418
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:31.310
David Witzel: And it's… I think it's that map and the territory kind of idea. Words have… we've trimmed words of a whole bunch of their meaning, you know, so we say, oh, the sky is blue.

419
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:46.760
David Witzel: But the sky's blue, it's, you know, this wonderful, all this stuff that's going on up there. We use the word blue, it's so simple, and AI will never understand all of the beauty, you know, and so you'll… it'll always have lost some of the sense of the… of whatever it is we're experiencing.

420
00:51:46.760 --> 00:52:00.210
David Witzel: And I felt really good about that for about 3 minutes, and then I realized that, well, the AIs are going to be able to suck in all the satellite data in a bunch of different dimensions that I can never experience. So, still, the AI's going to be able to sense in many more dimensions than I can sense.

421
00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:04.699
David Witzel: So we shouldn't still probably be afraid of the AI. But, but, …

422
00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:14.120
David Witzel: But I do think that, you know, we do our… in our effort to have joint sense-making, the colonialism part of it is this creating of the map problem.

423
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:20.319
David Witzel: Right, where we simplify ideas so that we can then share them, but when we do that, we've lost some of the senses.

424
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:28.439
Jerry Michalski: Dave, thank you. I think one of the pet peeves we haven't mentioned so far that you just put on the table is oversimplification.

425
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:42.660
Jerry Michalski: it's like, sometimes in order to get agreement, we… or we use a word that is simpler, but kind of good enough, or whatever, and we miss it. And one of my beliefs, one of my personal beliefs about this is that… excuse me…

426
00:52:42.780 --> 00:53:00.279
Jerry Michalski: Two people can never really agree completely on anything. There isn't… twins, born and raised the same, are going to be… are going to have a different understanding of some setting, context, sentence, whatever it might be, and it'll be colored by the last thing they read, or whatever it might be. We can never, ever get 100% overlap.

427
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:08.200
Jerry Michalski: What we can get is close to good enough agreement where major things aren't going to destroy the thing that's important to what we're agreeing on.

428
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:13.389
Jerry Michalski: And that, definitionally, we've squirreled down, chased down.

429
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:32.380
Jerry Michalski: enough of the weasel words, or words that might mean different things to different people. Sorry, short story. A really long time ago, when I launched a service in 1990 for new science called Intelligent Document Management, our VP of Sales came back from a meeting with IBM completely worried.

430
00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:39.679
Jerry Michalski: And he had… he had my issue of the review of Image Plus, IBM's imaging offer, all marked up in red.

431
00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:52.680
Jerry Michalski: And, he had just come back with a meeting with Dave Liddell. So I wound up, a week later, having a call with this VP at IBM, Dave Liddell, and he starts out very thoughtfully, and he says, Jerry, I think maybe we mean different things by the same words.

432
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:59.880
Jerry Michalski: And I'm like, what do you mean? He says, well, in your write-up, you said that ImagePlus was neither open, nor strategic.

433
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:13.260
Jerry Michalski: And to us, anything that's that big an offer in the product lineup is strategic, and anything that offers even a tiny little window where you could poke in data and pull out data is open. And to me, open is like open source.

434
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:25.570
Jerry Michalski: And strategic means it's actually strategic for the business in some way, and we had a delightful conversation, and he became my client. He signed up for my Intelligent Document Management Service. That was one of my early, early lessons in this

435
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:33.989
Jerry Michalski: Oh, wow, sometimes we mean very different things, and sometimes the context of the word is political internally, and the internal context and the politics of it

436
00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:46.589
Jerry Michalski: don't let you see very useful contexts that other people have for the same damned word, etc, etc, and we haven't even opened that cam. Anyway, there's so much interesting territory here. Jack, thank you for your patience.

437
00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:52.819
Jack Park: And thank you for that segue, Jerry, because, …

438
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.520
Jack Park: What I wanted to talk about

439
00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:05.039
Jack Park: is, first of all, at the highest level, sense-making, to me, is the left side of Theory U.

440
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:10.890
Jack Park: It's, it's, it's the side where you, you do the sensing.

441
00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:29.710
Jack Park: And you organize all the data, and now I want to go into collective intelligence, but I first want to ground the term intelligence in the fact that all biological entities, all organismic entities, are model builders.

442
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.050
Jack Park: And…

443
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:45.590
Jack Park: Basically, sense-making turns out to be as much aligning… sensing on the data in front of you as it is aligning the models in the room.

444
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:49.369
Jack Park: And this goes to collective intelligence.

445
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:53.090
Jack Park: And so, intelligence, in my view.

446
00:55:54.180 --> 00:56:00.540
Jack Park: As a model builder, is how you deal with expectation failures.

447
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:17.330
Jack Park: Think about it. If you are anticipating, your model is predicting the future, and the future doesn't happen the way you expect it, how do you deal with it? That's a degree of intelligence.

448
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:26.329
Jack Park: It's, it's, it's, it's like the, the, the, the young child that first encounters a large, ugly bug.

449
00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:37.759
Jack Park: how they deal with it is they run screaming to mom. But eventually, as they learn more and build a bigger model about what the bugs are.

450
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:47.090
Jack Park: they don't run screaming to Mom anymore. They may actually pick it up and hold it and look at it, or whatever. I mean, I remember my son

451
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:52.680
Jack Park: … at… I don't know, maybe…

452
00:56:54.330 --> 00:57:05.190
Jack Park: a year and a half old, walking over in Tennessee and noticing a gigantic Very, very bright blue beetle.

453
00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.370
Jack Park: Then he walked over and picked it up.

454
00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.989
Jack Park: He wasn't afraid of it.

455
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.320
Jack Park: He had a different model of the world than I do.

456
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:18.149
Jack Park: I… I… me, I wouldn't go near it. It was just a beetle.

457
00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:29.600
Jack Park: But, to me, it was ugly as hell. So, so through, through, through, through my model of the universe, collective sense-making.

458
00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.120
Jack Park: Is how the collective deals with

459
00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:43.180
Jack Park: The differences in their models and the oncoming input streams and, and, and…

460
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:56.440
Jack Park: I'm going… I'm going to use that just for a moment, sorry, to drag you sideways, and… and… and… and talk about Marc Antoine's hyperknowledge.

461
00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:05.909
Jack Park: Hyperknowledge, is about… This is… this… I'm channeling Marc Antoine, not putting words in his mouth.

462
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:20.869
Jack Park: And he'll likely correct me, and that's okay. That's what… that's what sense-making is about. But my understanding of Marc Antoine is that you are… you… you have an ecosystem of…

463
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:27.680
Jack Park: A platform which deals with multiple input streams.

464
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.860
Jack Park: And allows agents of all kinds

465
00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:36.680
Jack Park: to play with those streams as if they were GET repos.

466
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:48.529
Jack Park: And what that's… and I think that that's a model of what the brain does. So… so… I… I… I've… I've re…

467
00:58:48.750 --> 00:59:04.340
Jack Park: I've gone and reduced collective intelligence and all of that to Marc Antoine's hyperknowledge, which is… which is incorrect, but it's my sense of what's going on.

468
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:06.840
Jack Park: Over.

469
00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:08.390
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Jack.

470
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.490
Jerry Michalski: Klaus.

471
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:20.320
Klaus Mager: Yeah, along those same lines, I mean, I love TheoEU, and I've been an ardent,

472
00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:28.609
Klaus Mager: A student of it, … Intelligence really needs some definition, I think, because

473
00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:37.350
Klaus Mager: It… it really depends on the information that you have and the context that you live within.

474
00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:39.870
Klaus Mager: So, for example, a farmer

475
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:50.840
Klaus Mager: can be incredibly, intelligent about his soil, his land. You know, the, the, influence of

476
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:55.639
Klaus Mager: Climate, water, you know, soil conditions.

477
00:59:55.750 --> 01:00:00.689
Klaus Mager: You can have a craftsman who works with a material, let's say with wood.

478
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:17.460
Klaus Mager: who understands, who looks at this wood, touches it, and feels things about what he can create with this wood by carving it, that completely escapes anyone else. So is that intelligence?

479
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.819
Klaus Mager: So, there are layers of intelligence, so as we make decisions as a collective about farming, for example.

480
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:38.219
Klaus Mager: Is the decision-making body really informed and knowledgeable about what's happening in that soil?

481
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:49.940
Klaus Mager: Yet make decisions that, may completely alienate this farmer away from his soil. So there is a… there is a hierarchy in intelligence.

482
01:00:50.060 --> 01:01:01.800
Klaus Mager: You know, that… that has to be built from the ground on up into… into… into… into more narrative types of, intelligence. And…

483
01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:09.099
Klaus Mager: And I think that's where you would need

484
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:19.880
Klaus Mager: An unbiased, unfettered, intentional form of intelligence that is collective, meaning being respectful.

485
01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:30.170
Klaus Mager: You know, to every layer of, of intelligence that needs to be combined into… into a common understanding.

486
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:47.649
Klaus Mager: Yeah, and I think we are missing that, and there is a certain arrogance in our decision-making process, in our political decision-making process, that is so far removed from the reality of the natural world.

487
01:01:47.940 --> 01:02:01.500
Klaus Mager: You know, but just assumes that, it knows. And so it's that, I mean, Donnella Meadows, you know, the hierarchy of, of a system.

488
01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:08.739
Klaus Mager: Where in every layer of that hierarchy, there is an embedded intelligence.

489
01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:14.719
Klaus Mager: That needs to be heard, and that needs to be embedded and incorporated.

490
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:24.580
Klaus Mager: You know, and so I think that's what we're struggling with right now, because we have become… we… our collective intelligence is so far removed.

491
01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:33.839
Klaus Mager: You know, from… from what I would just maybe frame as reality, the natural world, you know, that we have gotten into a lot of trouble.

492
01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:45.620
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Klaus. Let's, Mark and Phil, I know you'd like to jump in. Let's take a short silence break, and I'll bring us back in, and you can jump in. So…

493
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:50.729
Jerry Michalski: Let's just be silent with this for a bit. We've been going hot and heavy for an hour.

494
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:58.410
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. I'm intrigued and a little bit worried that all this interest in generative AI has caused conversations about intelligence, consciousness, etc, etc, to just bubble over. I mean, that pot is boiling over right now in interesting ways and places, but …

495
01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:00.550
Jerry Michalski: Over to you, Marc Anton.

496
01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.480
Marc-Antoine Parent: Thanks for breaking the rhythm, because it is a matter of rhythm, isn't it?

497
01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:14.839
Marc-Antoine Parent: I want to build over what Klaus was saying, right? There's… We… a lot of…

498
01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:22.950
Marc-Antoine Parent: We have a problem with hubris and arrogance. We necessarily deal with simplified models of the world.

499
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:26.350
Marc-Antoine Parent: Because… limited cognitive capacity.

500
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:32.289
Marc-Antoine Parent: And believing that our map is the territory is hubris.

501
01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:38.509
Marc-Antoine Parent: And for me, the whole point of collective sense-making is

502
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:53.399
Marc-Antoine Parent: the act of triangulation and checking, you know, I have this map of the world that's necessarily partial, and let's compare maps a bit to see what I may have missed, or what you may have missed, or what we may all have missed.

503
01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:59.350
Marc-Antoine Parent: … And… It's a practice.

504
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:02.290
Marc-Antoine Parent: the ability.

505
01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:03.130
Jerry Michalski: to….

506
01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:09.889
Marc-Antoine Parent: Listen, the ability to not hold fast to our conclusions.

507
01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.420
Marc-Antoine Parent: To our map.

508
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.539
Marc-Antoine Parent: The, habit.

509
01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.779
Marc-Antoine Parent: of checking.

510
01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:24.589
Marc-Antoine Parent: We're… The rigidity of our assumptions, and the emotional stake we have in our beliefs.

511
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:34.410
Marc-Antoine Parent: And how we often bind it to our identity. I spoke of identity earlier, there's a positive sense of identity. Sometimes identity is what makes us

512
01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:45.210
Marc-Antoine Parent: remember to act in ways that are pro-social. And sometimes, identity is what makes us cling to a parochial view of the world.

513
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:49.860
Marc-Antoine Parent: And again, it's all a practice of questioning.

514
01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:59.710
Marc-Antoine Parent: kind of taking the time to question, why do I believe this? And I believe strongly in… Collective sense-making.

515
01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:04.739
Marc-Antoine Parent: As an arena, Where we may stop and listen.

516
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.990
Marc-Antoine Parent: And, and be confronted.

517
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.040
Marc-Antoine Parent: 2.

518
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:12.579
Marc-Antoine Parent: Other perspectives, because that's important.

519
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:32.939
Marc-Antoine Parent: That's… that's it. I wanted to go into practice and learning. For me, there's a pedagogy of sense-making, and that's something we're working on with Jack, with Sensecraft. It's, can we make it into a game? And the question of tempo is not fully addressed yet, but something I care deeply about. What is the tempo of

520
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:44.299
Marc-Antoine Parent: reading through what somebody else has said, and penetrating it, and trying to… okay, what does that mean? What does that mean to me? How can I not just react, but

521
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.909
Marc-Antoine Parent: Build on, and integrate.

522
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.760
Marc-Antoine Parent: What was said? Over.

523
01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.620
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

524
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:52.940
Jerry Michalski: Dave.

525
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.149
David Witzel: Yeah, I was, …

526
01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:06.450
David Witzel: I was thinking of maybe Mark and Jerry, what you'd said about AI, that… my thought is that the sense-making is collective, but the sense is individual.

527
01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:19.000
David Witzel: And one of the problems is trying to remember that the sense is individual, right? Because we then adopt our map and assume it's reality, and we forget that it isn't, and, you know, we have to go back and forth and re-update that.

528
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:43.509
David Witzel: And so then the violence comes when we try to take our individual sense and force other people to understand it, or to adopt it, which I think may be a critique of politics, you know, Mike, recently, that, you know, the technocracy was the effort of the elite to force a whole bunch of people to understand, you know, democracy, the good life, a whole bunch of things, in a way that they had decided was best, and then impose it through policy.

529
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:49.689
David Witzel: And we're seeing a reaction to that, which is, I don't care how bad it is, but you're not going to tell me what it should be.

530
01:07:49.690 --> 01:08:04.130
David Witzel: So, … but I was thinking, Jerry, I mean, and I don't want to take you off the sense-making stream, but I also feel like this group is not only about sense-making, right? Sense-making is one of the things that we do collectively.

531
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:10.030
David Witzel: And… and I was thinking, you know, actually, you know, the AI is a thing, it's gonna be there.

532
01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:15.599
David Witzel: to me, one of the push… the forces that will be balancing against AI is human connection.

533
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:24.039
David Witzel: And I think we've been undervaluing human connection. Can we need you, you know, back in this game, kind of, because

534
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:40.369
David Witzel: we have a whole bunch of technologies that support human connection, and human connection does sense-making as one of its things, but it's… there's so many things that human connection does, right? It's a… it's a fundamental relationship, and I think we've been… we've kind of…

535
01:08:40.680 --> 01:09:00.379
David Witzel: I would say, in a societal way, I mean, perhaps we have under, you know, this is… maybe it's… it's Putnam and social capital kinds of analysis, right? But we… we have a lot of skills and… and techniques that kind of reinforce and strengthen human

536
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:19.739
David Witzel: human connection, and I actually think, OGM, one of the really magical things about it is this collection of people who know so much about human connection getting together and connecting with each other, but we actually could be much more devoted to the idea of increasing connection, right? I mean, that there's, you know, there's tools, there are ideas, there's experiences that we have.

537
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:26.449
David Witzel: that are really special, that I think could, … can really make a contribution to global human connection.

538
01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:28.780
David Witzel: Which we're really gonna want.

539
01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:34.810
Jerry Michalski: … Dave, thank you. Let's just be quiet with that for just a second.

540
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:38.219
Jerry Michalski: Let's see… Worth sitting with.

541
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:54.420
Jerry Michalski: You also made me think that human connection is sometimes a shortcut to sense-making.

542
01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:10.189
Jerry Michalski: Meaning, if I bond with somebody in whatever way, and I really trust them, and something they do makes me realize that their advice or point of view on things is good, I will slide over and adopt a lot of their points of view, a lot of the way… a lot of the sense-making that I infer.

543
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:12.060
Jerry Michalski: From what they say and do.

544
01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:20.839
Jerry Michalski: and happily, you know, inhabit that space, I think. It's a… the trusted connection is a shortcut or a shorthand

545
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:34.550
Jerry Michalski: to the logical process of making your way through facts, or whatever it is. And then, earlier, I was thinking that there's some sense-making that has nothing to do with facts and logic. It's all about story and… and connection, and …

546
01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:40.590
Jerry Michalski: And those are important as well. Those are a form of sense-making as well. Mike?

547
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:50.940
Mike Nelson: A lot of richness there, and some of the previous comments. I don't think I've ever seen so much material in the chat, or so much good material.

548
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:57.179
Mike Nelson: I just wanted to add on to that idea that human connection is sort of the foundation.

549
01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:04.939
Mike Nelson: And say that one way we make sense and share sense is through stories.

550
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:14.919
Mike Nelson: And a lot of them aren't true. A lot of them are fairy tales. I mean, the truth in the Bible is probably more in, …

551
01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.879
Mike Nelson: The stories of how humans have interacted.

552
01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:24.099
Mike Nelson: And how there might be some greater power than it is in the specific…

553
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:33.600
Mike Nelson: principles that you're supposed to live your life around. I mean, Deuteronomy is not a good outline.

554
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.960
Mike Nelson: To define how you live your life.

555
01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:53.799
Mike Nelson: But some of the parables of Jesus, like the Good Samaritan, I think, are. So, I hope that at some point we'll spend more time on powerful untruths, or powerful untruths narratives. And that is what

556
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:59.329
Mike Nelson: the MAGA people have done so well. I mean, they know full well that the Haitians weren't eating dogs.

557
01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:16.629
Mike Nelson: But boy, that was a story that they all told each other, and it had the added virtue of owning the libs and making them upset that such a lie would go so far and influence so many people.

558
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:25.510
Mike Nelson: So I just want to… I talked earlier about how sense often is reflected in a negotiated document.

559
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:39.589
Mike Nelson: I think sense is also more powerfully conveyed in a story. And I'll just finish with one reference, one footnote. One of the most powerful things I've ever read in the Harvard Business Review

560
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:44.920
Mike Nelson: more than 15 years old, is called the CEO as Storyteller.

561
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:52.250
Mike Nelson: And it's a brilliant… … 7 or 8 page essay with lots of examples.

562
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.500
Mike Nelson: Of how, by changing the way a company thought.

563
01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.109
Mike Nelson: By telling just a couple stories.

564
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:06.160
Mike Nelson: Ceos can change the game, particularly a new CEO who's coming in to… Fix a big mess.

565
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:08.250
Mike Nelson: Over.

566
01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.470
Jerry Michalski: … Thanks, Mike.

567
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:18.880
Jerry Michalski: I didn't test that link, I hope it still works.

568
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.279
Jerry Michalski: But that should be the article at HBS.

569
01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.770
Marc-Antoine Parent: It's broken. I gave another one, I'm not sure it's the right one.

570
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:33.470
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. This was an article by Bronwyn Fryer and Robert McKee, called Happy Tales

571
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:39.140
Jerry Michalski: I'll put the title in, and then we can find a good link, and I'll correct the link in my brain. Thanks.

572
01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:40.530
Jerry Michalski: Rick?

573
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:51.050
Rick Botelho: Yeah, I've been using my silence to use co-intelligence about collective intelligence and the wisdom of the crowd.

574
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:55.889
Rick Botelho: And I came up with a… I was just asking questions to AI as we were going through.

575
01:13:56.010 --> 01:14:06.690
Rick Botelho: And this is very crude, because typically when you do something like that, you form a question, you formulate, you iterate on it, but so this is just a, a sort of, …

576
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:17.599
Rick Botelho: about 10 questions that came to mind, and we don't have time to do justice to any of them. But I think it speaks to how to create an inquiry mind.

577
01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:22.639
Rick Botelho: And, you know, Mike, last week we talked about the meaning of hen.

578
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:30.899
Rick Botelho: And you were encouraging me to simplify it. And actually, I think I've come up with a good rationale for not doing it, and just calling it N.

579
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:50.059
Rick Botelho: Because, you know, I got sort of lambasted by 3 people by saying, I've got to simplify it, simplify it, simplify it. That's the KISS principle. Yes, it has its merit, but I think somebody said during this conversation that sometimes when you simplify a word, it loses some of the original meaning.

580
01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:59.579
Rick Botelho: And so, the construct of this learning process is different to what we're experiencing now.

581
01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:12.330
Rick Botelho: And I invite… I'll put a link into that if people are curious about a different type of learning method that goes against the grain of what we've been taught. And the whole purpose of it, actually, is to shift

582
01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:29.709
Rick Botelho: from fast thinking to slow thinking, because most of the time we're in these groups, we pause a little bit. We may do a little slow thinking, but it's sort of rapid-fire, you know, communication, and it doesn't allow space. So the slow thinking can happen afterwards.

583
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:36.570
Rick Botelho: But one thing I haven't done yet, and I was wondering if anybody else's had, but Plexity has the capacity of doing group work.

584
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:56.699
Rick Botelho: And I was wondering whether anybody's had an experience with it, because what I just shared could be something that could be group work. People could look at the questions, you know, disagree or whatever it is, and try and prove it. But, you know, there are people who are… still remain highly skeptical of AI and what it can do for us.

585
01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:04.209
Rick Botelho: But what I think it's good at is lowering the flow of ignorance so that we can actually raise our collective wisdom.

586
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:15.629
Rick Botelho: And it can scope things out far quicker. I mean, for example, through this conversation, one thing that kept ricocheting through my mind was sociocracy. Now, that's just one method.

587
01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:16.050
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Funny enough.

588
01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:24.520
Rick Botelho: Of dealing with, … it's a different methodology for thinking about how groups can work together, where it's not consensus, it's consent.

589
01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.100
Rick Botelho: And that's different.

590
01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:36.649
Rick Botelho: That means everyone's objections to whatever's agreed is honored. You build middle… you build some middle ground where you say, is this good enough to move forward?

591
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:56.059
Rick Botelho: And then you can iterate based upon what your experience is of doing Wicked problems, such that somebody's… the outlier may have had the most important contribution, but got marginalized, and it may come to pass that that person's contribution was the most important, so it can be incorporated in.

592
01:16:56.290 --> 01:17:15.590
Rick Botelho: So I think there's different, frameworks of sociocracy, and there's different… people have been, you know, have different frames for what collective means. I mean, Klaus' frame of collective is different to some of other people's, and if we don't define the terms, then people's negative or positive connotations to the words

593
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:24.459
Rick Botelho: are going to get, it's going to, affect the flow of the conversation. Anyway, I'll put the link in for Hen.

594
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:35.639
Rick Botelho: And if people are interested. It's 25 modules there, and it's a course that I'm developing, for enabling people to develop their slow thinking skills.

595
01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.249
Rick Botelho: I'm Rick and I'm done speaking.

596
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:40.879
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Rick.

597
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:42.300
Jerry Michalski: It costs.

598
01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.330
Klaus Mager: Yeah, I've gone, …

599
01:17:48.800 --> 01:18:01.759
Klaus Mager: some work with Spyodynamics, and I've been into understanding this, and worked with AI, you know, to take a deep dive into,

600
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:08.050
Klaus Mager: Using… using spiral Dynamics as a… as a communications tool. …

601
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:15.520
Klaus Mager: So, you can play, with that by taking a concept.

602
01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:23.920
Klaus Mager: And explaining and spinning that concept out at a high cognitive level.

603
01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:27.900
Klaus Mager: And then explain that same concept.

604
01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:45.540
Klaus Mager: going through the spiral, going through, you know, the green, orange, red, I mean, blue, red stages, and see how the, the, you know, using AI, how it adapts this message

605
01:18:45.700 --> 01:19:00.399
Klaus Mager: to these different stages of cognition. And clearly, the story loses part of it, you know? If you are trying to explain to,

606
01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:19.819
Klaus Mager: I mean, I don't mean to put any qualitative into this, but let's say you go to a worker, you know, with a high school education, and you try to explain, you know, a concept that comes from a science perspective.

607
01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:28.140
Klaus Mager: You have to illustrate it in ways where it lives within the context of the person you're communicating with.

608
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:40.950
Klaus Mager: So, the same is true if you're communicating with a farmer. You know, the conceptual expression is stiff, has to be adapted to that farmer.

609
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:51.460
Klaus Mager: If you insist on keeping your language at the level that, is… You know, where, where, …

610
01:19:51.650 --> 01:20:05.920
Klaus Mager: where you are, or where someone you're listening to is, and not wanting to change it, because you don't want to lose anything. What you do is you lose the person you want to communicate with, because they don't get anything.

611
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:21.930
Klaus Mager: So there is a need to adapt, you know, to, to the stages and the, the cognitive development of your audience. And that's coming back to Donila Meadows. I mean, that's clearly…

612
01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:39.249
Klaus Mager: you know, what the pyramid of a system, what she is saying. You know, you have to adjust to each stage and speak the language of that stage in order to be heard and in order to hear as well, you know.

613
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:46.169
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Klaus. I think that, this whole… this notion of,

614
01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:48.760
Jerry Michalski: The work you've done to adapt

615
01:20:48.890 --> 01:21:01.399
Jerry Michalski: the messages you have to people at different levels in the spiral Dynamics model is very much some sort of adaptive sense-making or something like that. You're trying to connect to different people who might have different

616
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:16.339
Jerry Michalski: priorities, values, etc, etc, and so you've asked the AIs to help you change the wording and the metaphors and the everything done so that it might click for different audiences. It's been really, really fascinating to watch. I appreciate that.

617
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:23.520
Jerry Michalski: … Let me ask a question that came up a little bit earlier in this call, which is.

618
01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:29.609
Jerry Michalski: And I know that sense-making is one of the things that OGM is nominally meant to do.

619
01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:39.269
Jerry Michalski: Are we doing enough of it? Should we do more of it? Should we change how we do it? I'm happy to… I did, I think, only once. I don't think I did this twice. Maybe I did it two calls?

620
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:52.089
Jerry Michalski: But I challenged people to show up with their own sense-making tools, and we talked about something for 20 minutes, and then we compared notes on how we had made sense of the conversation with, you know, people screen-sharing, their own note-taking, and so forth.

621
01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.280
Jerry Michalski: I… I…

622
01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:13.049
Jerry Michalski: could have gone back and done that a dozen times, and seen if we got really good at it, or if we developed some practices out of it. I'm interested in those kinds of things. I'm very pleased that this call got a lot of interest from y'all, that people I haven't seen in a while showed up. That's great. But what do you think? Gil?

623
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.020
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: … I think I'm not interested in it.

624
01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:28.509
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: For the reasons that I asked at the top of the call, after… 83 minutes of this.

625
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.090
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I still don't know what we mean by sense, and what we mean by sense-making.

626
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:39.160
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I think what we're meaning by sense-making is coming to common interpretations about things.

627
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:44.810
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which is, you know, maybe a useful thing to do, but maybe not. Again, the B deviance.

628
01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.509
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And Ken's recent comment about how

629
01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:51.920
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: How narrow the scope of this community is.

630
01:22:52.280 --> 01:23:02.859
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Raises the question of what, you know, what's the value of sense-making if our, if our senses and our experience and our perceptions are so, well, undiverse, if that's the word?

631
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:08.380
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: How can we make sense of the world that we're in with such a narrow experience of the world that we're in?

632
01:23:13.190 --> 01:23:17.329
Jerry Michalski: And I don't think I saw Ken say that, so… that's news to me.

633
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.530
Jerry Michalski: ….

634
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:20.099
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Check the chat.

635
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:23.240
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. There was… there was so much chat that, yeah.

636
01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.349
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There's a lot of chat, a couple minutes back.

637
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.680
Jerry Michalski: Yay.

638
01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:32.630
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: observation, with the exception of Stacy, everyone on this call is male, all are white, all are highly educated, I think all are over 45.

639
01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.710
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And all of us use…

640
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:48.429
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: embedded in and acculturated to the social norms of the Global North. So the sense-making that is taking place here is lacking the diversity of gender, ethnicity, and Global South experiences, and thinking this is a tiny sample to explore sense-making with.

641
01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.389
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm sorry.

642
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:51.980
Jerry Michalski: Thanks for reading that into the recording, I appreciate that as well.

643
01:23:51.980 --> 01:24:08.620
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, I think it's an important observation, and it goes to my question about… I… and I don't mean to be the wise guy saying this, Jerry. I mean, it's really clear… true to me in the moment, because that's the kind of sense-making that I'm doing, that I don't know what we're trying to do here.

644
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.010
Jerry Michalski: Which is a question maybe for next week. I'm… I'm… I'm… and I don't wanna….

645
01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:19.889
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No, I don't mean what we're trying to do with OGM in general. I love what we're doing with OGM in general, whatever the hell it is, and I.

646
01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:20.260
Jerry Michalski: Okay.

647
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:25.350
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: back to this, and I'm pruning my Zoom groups, my calendar, and this one stays.

648
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:29.179
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So that's clear. The, the, …

649
01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:34.019
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Let me tongue-in-cheek call it this obsession with sense-making.

650
01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:43.499
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't understand that. And I put in the chat a conversation that Ken and I hosted, two years ago, called Stop Making Sense Making.

651
01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:45.599
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And invite people to have a look.

652
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.500
Jerry Michalski: ….

653
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:51.110
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: With homage, of course, to David Byrne.

654
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:59.530
Jerry Michalski: And, exactly. We have a couple people in the queue, and then possibly a phone from Ken, so we're near the end of our call time. Scott?

655
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:07.810
Jerry Michalski: You, lowered your hand, but you didn't unmute.

656
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.489
Scott Moehring: I got the sense.

657
01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:30.509
Jerry Michalski: And whenever you… whenever we unmute, if you can keep your hand up while you're talking, that keeps you up in the top near the camera for me, which I like a lot, because the moment you unpin, you go somewhere randomly into my grid, and now I've got to hunt for you, and often you're down below, like, Scott, you're down near the bottom of my screen now, so just as a going forward, if you want to keep your hand up while you… after you unmute, that would be super and great. Go ahead, Scott.

658
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:31.260
Scott Moehring: Awesome.

659
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:46.620
Scott Moehring: I got the sense that, like many of our calls, this… the topic of sense-making went to a meta level. It was not actually about making sense, it was about talking about what sense-making was, which I feel is more universal than

660
01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:52.320
Scott Moehring: our individual experiences of making sense. So, when I read Ken's comment, I think.

661
01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:05.260
Scott Moehring: I absolutely agree with that with the sense that is being made, but with the topic of what is collective sense-making and what is that collective intelligence, I think that this is an appropriate curve.

662
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:07.859
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Scott.

663
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.810
Jerry Michalski: Rick.

664
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:21.999
Rick Botelho: Yeah, just a quick couple of things. One is, you know, there is the Grace Wong Guild that many of you probably know for sense-making. There's also the Institute of General Semantics as well.

665
01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.900
Rick Botelho: And where I would overlap with some of Gil's concerns is that

666
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.680
Rick Botelho: You know, you have these academic disciplines, and they go into great depth in defining them, but…

667
01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:53.599
Rick Botelho: they're only one lens, and I think it does help to at least start off with a definition of whatever it is we're talking about, so that I can understand the differences and similarities between how people are framing sense-making, whether it's at a practical level or at a meta level.

668
01:26:53.750 --> 01:27:03.290
Rick Botelho: And I think having that as a grounding, at least then you can critique the… you can say where you differ with the definition, then you can understand where the differences lie, so…

669
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:05.709
Rick Botelho: That's getting into semantics.

670
01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:15.010
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, and I could have begun with a couple definitions, and it might have helped you and Gil, and so forth. So, good point. Thank you.

671
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:18.849
Jerry Michalski: Marc Antoine, was that you with your hand raised that just went down accidentally?

672
01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:23.720
Marc-Antoine Parent: Yes, that was an accident, apologies. Go for it.

673
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.390
Marc-Antoine Parent: It is fascinating how we're…

674
01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:35.349
Marc-Antoine Parent: always arguing about words, because we're always arguing with words. It's a bit… it comes with the territory. That's language for you. …

675
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.110
Marc-Antoine Parent: I…

676
01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:46.340
Marc-Antoine Parent: don't understand, personally, guilt, sorry, I don't understand your frustration with what do we mean by sense, and what do we mean by sense-making, in the sense that

677
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.230
Marc-Antoine Parent: We're busy negotiating it.

678
01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.560
Marc-Antoine Parent: And negotiating shared meaning.

679
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:56.999
Marc-Antoine Parent: So that we can… Have connection at all?

680
01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:03.019
Marc-Antoine Parent: Have communication at all, have shared community, and maybe even act on it at some point.

681
01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:07.870
Marc-Antoine Parent: And learn the praxis of… …

682
01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:18.789
Marc-Antoine Parent: Thinking with others, because for me, it's an essential praxis, like, of learning to listen, learning to see the other perspectives.

683
01:28:19.650 --> 01:28:21.859
Marc-Antoine Parent: And I don't expect

684
01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:27.959
Marc-Antoine Parent: a formal definition of sense-making to emerge or be agreed on. What I do think is

685
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:31.500
Marc-Antoine Parent: We're here because we have some shared goals.

686
01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:36.430
Marc-Antoine Parent: And… Having some kinds of agreement.

687
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:40.299
Marc-Antoine Parent: Or some kinds of negotiating meaning and under… and…

688
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:49.190
Marc-Antoine Parent: Negotiating understanding is part of it. I choose to call that sense-making. That word has obviously offended some of us.

689
01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.209
Marc-Antoine Parent: Because they probably attach different meaning to the word, or different connotations.

690
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:58.690
Marc-Antoine Parent: That's normal. That's always going to happen. We'll always have

691
01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:16.690
Marc-Antoine Parent: dissent over what does the word mean, and this is why I'm saying shared consensus is terrible. The illusion of consensus is terrible. We think we mean the same thing by the same word. We don't. We had a little argument about what do we mean by prediction? We had different

692
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:25.859
Marc-Antoine Parent: definitions of prediction. It's fine. … and… But, it is very useful

693
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:31.690
Marc-Antoine Parent: to… and there, I salute your effort, Gil, to step back. What are we trying to accomplish?

694
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:39.860
Marc-Antoine Parent: But the reality is, again, there won't be a definitive answer. We are each coming with our agenda, we're trying to find

695
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:47.039
Marc-Antoine Parent: Identify what we're trying to… accomplish in common from our…

696
01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:57.970
Marc-Antoine Parent: existing individual agenda. I say there's no such thing as an individual, not totally true. But all our individual agendas come from a history of collective negotiation also.

697
01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:01.820
Marc-Antoine Parent: … I don't expect…

698
01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:10.860
Marc-Antoine Parent: us to ever agree on a final definition. But I do think it's important to work on the definition progress to see

699
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:13.369
Marc-Antoine Parent: To explore where the agreement lies.

700
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:19.479
Marc-Antoine Parent: Over. It's about how much do we want to use words? How much do we want to rely on words?

701
01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:23.840
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Marc Antoine. Someday we should have a call without words. I think that'd be pretty cool.

702
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:26.720
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Especially if we could do it with miming.

703
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:33.929
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, yeah, I think we'll do the Marcel Marceau, call, and everybody needs to come in whiteface and just mind what we say.

704
01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:34.590
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Will we do.

705
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:37.740
Marc-Antoine Parent: Jazz improv.

706
01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:43.100
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, we did have a chat and chat about jazz, which is not words, but it's communication and perhaps sense-making.

707
01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.390
Jerry Michalski: Oh, totally.

708
01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.230
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Build on what Marc Antoine was saying, actually.

709
01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:48.310
Jerry Michalski: Go back to it, Ken.

710
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.740
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Go kid.

711
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:49.910
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: …

712
01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:55.680
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: A few years ago, I was doing a workshop, at, for the National Park Service at Yosemite on conflict.

713
01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:11.659
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And I did not… I'm very suspicious of definitions, because if my definition is different than yours, you're going to disagree with me. So, there were 35 people in the room, we gave everybody a stack of post-its and a marker, and said, please write down all the words and short phrases that come to mind when you think of the word conflict.

714
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:27.019
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And there were over 400 responses that went up on the wall. And we put them… had people arrange them from the least, bothersome to the most bothersome. And under the most bothersome column, someone had written organ failure.

715
01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:35.940
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And I said, who wrote organ failure? And someone raised her hand, I said, what does that mean? She said, that's when the conflict is so bad, I'm afraid I'm gonna have a heart attack.

716
01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:43.880
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I said, how many people had organ failure in your definition of conflict before? No one really asked. I said, how many have that now? Everybody raised their hand. So…

717
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:49.380
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: to go to Marc Antoine's point, it's not about… this is a difference from sense-making and shared meaning.

718
01:31:49.380 --> 01:32:10.279
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: We expanded the shared meaning by allowing everybody to say, this is all the shit I think about when I think about conflict. Not trying to nail it down to a fine definition, but rather, let's get it all out on the table and take a look at it and say, wow, within this group, this is what it means. And if we had a group 10 times the size, there'd be even more, you know? So it…

719
01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:20.739
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: becomes expansive and exponentially synthetic, synthesizing, rather than reduced down to a final definition. And I think that's a much more effective way

720
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:24.869
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: To approach something like this, where we want to get a sense of shared meaning.

721
01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:27.680
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Over to you, Alex.

722
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:29.050
Jerry Michalski: Alex?

723
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.930
Alex Kladitis: Do we have any more time? Because I can skip this.

724
01:32:33.930 --> 01:32:35.459
Jerry Michalski: Go right ahead.

725
01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:41.759
Alex Kladitis: Okay, I'm… I'm just going to contribute in this following way.

726
01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:49.130
Alex Kladitis: I didn't know what sense… the purpose… the purpose, not the meaning, the purpose of what we were doing here.

727
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.089
Alex Kladitis: And, I enjoy the discussion.

728
01:32:52.490 --> 01:33:05.349
Alex Kladitis: But I could not find a thread in it, and can I just say, I'm not academic in the way that I would analyze a prose and know what's going on. Like, whatever, you know, I'm a bit more practical. You say this, you mean that.

729
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.760
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: but….

730
01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:09.709
Alex Kladitis: So, I'm not saying what you're doing is wrong, I'm just saying that's what I'm like.

731
01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:18.500
Alex Kladitis: So, listening to everything else, I was not able to say… I cannot say what it is you guys were actually

732
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:31.540
Alex Kladitis: Yeah, you discuss things, you discuss sense, you discuss make… but I don't know what the outcome… because that's the way I'm oriented. Not because you did anything wrong, it's just I'm oriented to solutionizing.

733
01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:36.149
Alex Kladitis: And there were no solutions here that I could see. It was just discussion about

734
01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:46.059
Alex Kladitis: two words, sense-making, and sometimes sense-making as a third. And I'm not saying this to complain, I'm happy that I was here.

735
01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:54.219
Alex Kladitis: But I didn't identify with it, other than a set of people Talking about what they think

736
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:56.729
Alex Kladitis: About those three words and the combination of it.

737
01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:59.609
Alex Kladitis: It's not bad, you know, I'm okay, but… but…

738
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:06.309
Alex Kladitis: for a while, I was lost. I thought, what are we trying to do here? Because I thought there was an objective, but obviously there isn't.

739
01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.999
Alex Kladitis: It's a discussion, and I accept that, and I don't have a problem with it.

740
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:16.150
Alex Kladitis: But I just thought I'd let you know that We're not all the same.

741
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:27.179
Jerry Michalski: Absolutely. Now, Alex, thank you for that, and we didn't even get to whether sense-making should have a hyphen or not. I mean, we didn't even touch that, which clearly would have sparked another…

742
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:37.629
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. I think that… I think between what Ken said and what you just said, those are really nice and different, bows to put on the conversation.

743
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:40.840
Jerry Michalski: Can hast thou a poem?

744
01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:42.650
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I do.

745
01:34:43.290 --> 01:34:47.809
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: This one's called A Note Passed to Superman by Lucille Clifton.

746
01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:54.290
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Sweet Jesus, Superman! If I'd seen you, dressed in your blue suit, I would have known you.

747
01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:59.399
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Maybe that choir boy Clark can stand around listening to stories, but not you.

748
01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:04.290
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Not with Metropolis to save, and every crooked town filthy with kryptonite.

749
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:13.670
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Lord, Man of Steel, I understand the cape, the leggings, the whole ball of wax. You can trust me. There is no planet stranger than the one I'm from.

750
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.610
Jerry Michalski: Beautiful.

751
01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:20.079
Jerry Michalski: Beautiful, thank you.

752
01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:26.819
Jerry Michalski: And that made perfect sense to everyone in the same way.

753
01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.220
Jerry Michalski: Right?

754
01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:33.080
Alex Kladitis: Can I add something just quickly? Last week's poem.

755
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:38.800
Alex Kladitis: last week's poem was brilliant. I… it touched me. I thought it was the most… one of the most brilliant poems.

756
01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.909
Alex Kladitis: I sent it to my wife and kids.

757
01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.449
Alex Kladitis: My kids said, great poem.

758
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:46.769
Alex Kladitis: My wife… my wife said, that's not a perm.

759
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.590
Alex Kladitis: Wow.

760
01:35:51.590 --> 01:36:02.129
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Then it did its job. Then it did its job. Can we define poem? Hey, can we define good poem? Oh….

761
01:36:02.130 --> 01:36:06.939
Jerry Michalski: At this point, I wish I had some outro music that was the Twilight Zone closing, but ….

762
01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:10.640
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Here we go.

763
01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:14.790
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, everybody. … See y'all in a week!

764
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.010
Jerry Michalski: Bye for now.

765
01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:17.550
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Ciao.

766
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:19.550
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And someday we'll make sense of poetry.

767
01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.180
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Or not.
