00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.080
Jerry Michalski: This is the Open Global Mind weekly call for Thursday, September 4th, 2025.

2
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.849
Jerry Michalski: On the first Thursdays of every month, we do a check-in call, where we have

3
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.080
Jerry Michalski: funky little check-in routine that I think most everybody… I think everybody who's here has done before, but I'll just repeat it briefly.

4
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:27.060
Jerry Michalski: I am not going to be a traffic cop during check-in. Everybody just sort of volunteers to step forward and check in. Only once, please, no comments back and forth.

5
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:45.490
Jerry Michalski: We have a moratorium on chat while we're checking in, so please don't use the chat, but you can save stuff in your chat, just don't hit enter. And then, once everybody's gone once, I'll step in, and we'll go to usual sort of salon mode, and then free for all in the chat is okay.

6
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.919
Jerry Michalski: During check-in mode, we like pauses, so quiet moments are not awkward moments, they're moments like Quaker Meeting, where you're appreciating

7
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:06.130
Jerry Michalski: the moment, or the people, or the setting, or whatever you'd like to appreciate. That works great. That's one of the reasons we developed this check-in mode, was to have some quiet.

8
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.399
Jerry Michalski: Even while we're busy, like, Zooming and all that.

9
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.830
Jerry Michalski: And,

10
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:28.360
Jerry Michalski: And don't empty your brain of everything that's on your mind. Try to be moderately brief so that we can get through check-ins and get to conversations. So, check in on something sort of OGM-y that's in your head, that's, that's with you.

11
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:36.279
Jerry Michalski: But don't… don't tick off, like, the list of things you've banked for the week that you wanted to tell everybody at OGM about. That's a little… usually that's a little too long.

12
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:46.819
Jerry Michalski: With that, I'm going to mute my mic, and whoever would like to can step in, and we'll be off and running.

13
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.179
Jerry Michalski: Rick, you ever thought… thought?

14
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.539
Jerry Michalski: Or a question?

15
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.519
Jerry Michalski: Nope, I just heard some noise from your mic.

16
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.619
Jerry Michalski: Sean, I just explained the check-in routine, which I think you're familiar with, correct?

17
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.419
Jerry Michalski: Not hearing Sean yet, but we shall see.

18
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.650
Jerry Michalski: Alright, I will mute, and whoever would like to go first, take your time, and go first.

19
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:57.040
Kevin Jones: Well, I'll go. People on this list know I was in the heart of Helene in Swanonoa.

20
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.719
Kevin Jones: Which was the part of the impact.

21
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.270
Kevin Jones: And… we gave up on FEMA and have moved to an apartment in the River Arts District.

22
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.929
Kevin Jones: But, and my kids might be able to create what they want out of the…

23
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.020
Kevin Jones: Land that's behind, but we can't think about it.

24
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.140
Kevin Jones: But I met this morning with the woman who leads the…

25
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.070
Kevin Jones: The outside of the safety net, work.

26
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.069
Kevin Jones: She got some funding, and they have 7 people that work with Suwanoa Cares.

27
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.800
Kevin Jones: A lot of Latinos, 3 of them used to clean Airbnbs, but they were community leaders, and now they're paid to be

28
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:53.969
Kevin Jones: sort of social workers in that space, and I… but it was great, because I wanted to know… so she finally had to give up and take a couple weeks in the south of France and get away from the sadness. It's a…

29
00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.299
Kevin Jones: Our devastation remains, and we're a low-status neighborhood, and they're not doing anything, and the county is…

30
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.079
Kevin Jones: And nothing is happening. And,

31
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.880
Kevin Jones: So, but she went back to it, and so I wanted to meet with her and say, how are you doing this?

32
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:30.049
Kevin Jones: She explained that's who she is, and it turns out that there is some money to create a third place, and some of that is coming into here, and I can help her organize the capital around, you know, she has a nail salon, and there's a

33
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.679
Kevin Jones: They're renting a quick stop, and, you know, there is no place people gather. Eleanor Ostrom said.

34
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:51.310
Kevin Jones: Watersheds can be managed 47% better by ranchers than by the government if they have a place where they meet regularly and have informal conversations, and the…

35
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.190
Kevin Jones: There's not treaties, but the relationships up and downstream are… are transparent.

36
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.589
Kevin Jones: And we have nothing like that. There's no grocery store, it's gone, the post office is gone, the hardware store is gone, all the restaurants are gone, so…

37
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:20.339
Kevin Jones: Creating that, and then trying to stop the land rush of folks, you know, we're the… before the flood, we were $100,000 less per house, and we were $300 less per rent.

38
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.910
Kevin Jones: And so,

39
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:36.689
Kevin Jones: Anyway, it's really neat to… there's a certain place I can be working with the people, working with the people with the problems, but if I'm down there, I'm really terrible, and can't stand the sadness. She can stand the sadness, and so it was really encouraging.

40
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:48.960
Kevin Jones: that, you know, oh, there's a place for me to be able to look at Swano, because I, you know, it's… we lost a million bucks on the land and house, and so it's hard to think about.

41
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.590
Kevin Jones: But,

42
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.300
Kevin Jones: It's a way to think about it, and I'm gonna work on a thing with my kids, and so…

43
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:06.029
Kevin Jones: I'm really glad to not be immersed in that sad place. We're in the arts district, and the artists are determined to

44
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:15.129
Kevin Jones: Work in these live-work lofts and sell, and so they're coming back in the places that weren't totally flooded, and it's not sad.

45
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:23.100
Kevin Jones: And with these trauma areas, you just… you know, some people can be around the sad for a long time and live with it, and I couldn't do it.

46
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.070
Kevin Jones: So anyway, it's a little bit encouraging, even though,

47
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.089
Kevin Jones: It's a neglected, low-status area, and people have forgotten about Helene.

48
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.390
Kevin Jones: But, you know, nobody relies on the federal government anymore, so…

49
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:48.520
Kevin Jones: We have that, but there are ways to invest without the federal government, through community investment funds in land, so we're looking to

50
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:57.240
Kevin Jones: it's just great to, you know, I can actually think about doing what I do without having to be down in where it's… it's just too sad to go.

51
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.390
Kevin Jones: to where I used to live, because it's, you know… Gardens covered by sand dunes.

52
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.519
Kevin Jones: That's my checkout.

53
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:59.069
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: not to respond to Kevin, but, Kevin, hearing what you said reminds me of stories I've seen this week about New Orleans.

54
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.470
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And how… And how much has not been recovered?

55
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.169
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Since their devastation, what, 10 years ago now?

56
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.030
Kevin Jones: 20.

57
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.720
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: 20.

58
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.510
Kevin Jones: Low-status neighborhoods, after the emergency stuff.

59
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:23.280
Kevin Jones: leaves are still low status, you know, that's the thing. It's the low status that doesn't change.

60
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.810
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

61
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.970
Jerry Michalski: Others… We're trying to prevent conversation.

62
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.820
Kevin Jones: Right. Anyway, yeah.

63
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.400
Jerry Michalski: But I appreciate this.

64
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.760
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: We're not conversing, we're just sharing observations.

65
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.350
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, yeah.

66
00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:43.430
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But, yeah. Friend of mine for me, besides… well, I guess I'll say two things.

67
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:55.710
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: At the national level, I'm really struck by the conversation of people who say, it's all over, nobody's doing anything.

68
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:05.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: quote, nobody's doing anything. It's a meme that I hear a lot. And in fact, there's lots of people doing lots of stuff, and various, you know, Heather Cox Richardson and others are chronicling that.

69
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.300
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm… Glad to see…

70
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:18.100
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Glad to see the state's rights focus shifting to the blue states now, as Washington, Oregon, California, Illinois, and so forth are starting to mount.

71
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.340
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: a different, different level of resistance.

72
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:37.780
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: In personal terms, it's been a very body-focused week for me this week. I fell on Sunday and, quote, sustained a concussion, as they say. Yeah, and I'm okay. It was mild, you know, no cracks in my head, no bleeds, etc.

73
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:47.429
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I learned that if you're over 65 and you fall, or if you're on auto… if you're on anticoagulants and you fall, you go to the ER, period, even if you feel fine. So, learned that one.

74
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:56.259
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But the protocol, there's a concussion is not a clinical diagnosis, it's a… it's a, you know, symptomatic diagnosis, and the deal is that you have to rest.

75
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.850
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And if you don't rest, your body will enforce the rest.

76
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.009
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And the major advisory is to stay off screens.

77
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:10.519
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And mental stimulation, which screens are a vivid kind, because there's lots of sensory input, and man, that's hard to do!

78
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:20.940
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: In this modern life. You know, so I've… I've done it a lot, and I'm much more… much less engaged, but it's hard… for me, it's hard to be completely unplugged.

79
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.570
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I had a fairly busy day Tuesday,

80
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:33.269
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Lots of coaching, coached a client on an acquisition, and coached a client on a career development, and coached a client on,

81
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:42.160
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: A product launch, and new positioning for a company, and like, you know, engaged on the calls, full on, full presence, and then just wiped out.

82
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:55.229
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Afterwards. Just, like, wiped out. Yeah, you know, I have to sit down for a couple hours and close my eyes and not do anything, which is… I noticed that my normal recourse when I relax is to pick up this thing and scroll.

83
00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:06.700
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It's like, nope, don't do that. So it's been very, very humbling and grounding, in a way, to just sort of be back in touch with the rhythms of the body and learn how that works, and

84
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.900
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There was some conclusion about that.

85
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.779
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, just, you know, running at a very different pace this week.

86
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.730
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, that's… that's what I have to say for now.

87
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:50.120
Rob O'Keefe: So I can, I can jump in, go next. I think many of you know that I'm not on these calls too much. I typically have a work meeting that, canceled today to be able to join, and

88
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.749
Rob O'Keefe: I live in Washington, D.C, and it feels like

89
00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:03.550
Rob O'Keefe: there's some people paying attention to what is going on in DC, but I also feel like since Elon has left.

90
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:15.800
Rob O'Keefe: Sort of a side effect of him in not engaging is some of… some of the attention that… maybe… maybe some of the outrage that he drew is… it's not there as much.

91
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:24.539
Rob O'Keefe: when there just continues to be, you know, thing after thing after thing after thing, attacks on what I would call a tax on the federal government.

92
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:34.450
Rob O'Keefe: People that have given their lives, careers to, government service, whether, whether those services are delivered,

93
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:44.510
Rob O'Keefe: you know, to the levels that we all want is another story, but these people are, you know, putting their heart and soul into the missions of the government.

94
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:57.899
Rob O'Keefe: you guys may not know that there's a government shutdown coming at the end of September, and most people think that the government will shut down, just because it's such a heightened political environment.

95
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:08.650
Rob O'Keefe: There's a couple of options that could happen. One could be a partial shutdown, where they figure out budgets for certain agencies, or it could be a complete shutdown.

96
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:25.939
Rob O'Keefe: Of course, even with a complete shutdown, people that are deemed, or positions, or roles, or missions that are deemed essential keep working, so then there's this whole process of figuring out who should get the label of essential, and then what are those rest of the people, like, hey, you're not essential.

97
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.520
Rob O'Keefe: Like, thanks!

98
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:37.169
Rob O'Keefe: So, our company does consulting for the federal government, so that potentially will be an impact for us, but probably not.

99
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:52.839
Rob O'Keefe: For reasons I won't go into. On a personal note, my daughter is entering her sophomore year at NYU, and so we dropped her off. She is in film school, which, on the one hand, is like,

100
00:13:52.980 --> 00:14:12.650
Rob O'Keefe: you know, top jobs that will be replaced by AI, although I'd say that in jest because… and she and I had talked about this, and I said, the world needs storytellers, and whether you're using AI tools or, you know, holding a camera or painting with a brush, you know, that there's still… there's still…

101
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:19.759
Rob O'Keefe: room and needs for storytelling, and I think at some point, I think most of us think there'll be a…

102
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:28.319
Rob O'Keefe: What's the word? Appreciation for authentic art. I think even already, we're getting so sick of

103
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:45.019
Rob O'Keefe: AI-generated stuff, so I think, I'm… I'm excited. I think she'll be a… if her current interests continue, she'll be a documentarist, so that will be interesting. She's interested in all kinds of things. Interesting as a film…

104
00:14:45.550 --> 00:15:01.020
Rob O'Keefe: school student, she watches very few movies. So she loves Broadway shows, she loves being in the theater, she watches some episode TV, but not a lot of long-form movies, which I think is kind of interesting.

105
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:21.389
Rob O'Keefe: So I'm dropping her off in New York City. We're there, we're there periodically through the year, and just reminded that the energy level of New York is just unmatched. The people mixing in all walks of life, all economic statuses co-mingled,

106
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.950
Rob O'Keefe: and struck me about DC,

107
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:31.499
Rob O'Keefe: which has been labeled as this crime-ridden city, which it's not. New York, gets similar labels.

108
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:44.309
Rob O'Keefe: And I think people that are outside these cities just hear the headlines, and they just buy the headlines, and that's just sort of been something I've been thinking about. Certainly, there are…

109
00:15:45.050 --> 00:16:00.539
Rob O'Keefe: crime… high crime areas of every city, but there's also concentrations of artists and musicians and restaurants and food and creativity. So, as with everything in life, it's a… it's a mixed… it's a mixed bag.

110
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:08.700
Rob O'Keefe: So yeah, I think for me, I just continue to try to… limit…

111
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:21.589
Rob O'Keefe: sources, you know, feeds… feeds of information, try to be more selective, pick and choose the things that I want to ingest, and then try to reflect on them and… and see what…

112
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:29.970
Rob O'Keefe: Try to… try to have clarity on my views of topics and things that are not just headline… headline-driven.

113
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.050
Rob O'Keefe: So yeah, I think I'll, I'll wrap it up there.

114
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:06.130
Klaus Mager: Yeah, maybe add… add a photo. I've been,

115
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:13.910
Klaus Mager: So focused on the, on the food part of the economy.

116
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.689
Klaus Mager: And, and, you know, pretty much on a, on a, meta level, because I've worked

117
00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.399
Klaus Mager: I'm on the,

118
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:28.910
Klaus Mager: advisory team for federal policy for the Sierra Club, for example, now Farm Bill Policy, and…

119
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.410
Klaus Mager: the Citizen Climate Loppee, and, and

120
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:42.959
Klaus Mager: the Alcoa organization, so I've been, closely tracking, you know, what is happening policy-wise.

121
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.510
Klaus Mager: And, and tried to…

122
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:56.679
Klaus Mager: To have some influence on this and provide, you know, some, some feedback that, hopefully is helpful, but…

123
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:12.180
Klaus Mager: So from that position, I've stepped way back, because I'm just feeling it's a complete waste of time. The Sarah Club sends a team to Washington, lobby team, and you talk to

124
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:25.420
Klaus Mager: members of Congress who just cashed a half million dollar check from some lobbyist, and then the Silver Club shows up and has an opinion, you know? I mean, it's just… it's just, hopeless.

125
00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.120
Klaus Mager: But what really strikes me is…

126
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.489
Klaus Mager: The… the destructiveness of this current administration.

127
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:42.539
Klaus Mager: Because the food system, you know, is a massive contributor to environmental degradation.

128
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.930
Klaus Mager: Not just… not just carbon emissions, but the… not the…

129
00:18:48.230 --> 00:19:04.830
Klaus Mager: pollution of water tables, of watersheds, chemicals, overloading the natural environment. I mean, it's just a horror show. And the scale of it is absolutely incredible, and the scale is increasing. I mean, they're doubling down on…

130
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:15.000
Klaus Mager: On these practices that are so… that are so harmful to, the entire, ecology. The, you know, the,

131
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.310
Klaus Mager: the, biosystem.

132
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:24.360
Klaus Mager: So, I've been working with AI now to build up an intelligence.

133
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:34.909
Klaus Mager: That, that can assist, you know, to, to, to, to create a, a transition from.

134
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.899
Klaus Mager: From this current industrial system.

135
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:49.150
Klaus Mager: Into a more regenerative form of functioning, you know, generating food and growing and raising food.

136
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:56.799
Klaus Mager: And because of, you know, my background, I… and, and, you know, some…

137
00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:11.629
Klaus Mager: really training I got with Gene, working with Gene Bellinger for the last 6 years or so, and I'm really thinking through, on… on what this, all means from a systems perspective.

138
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:19.750
Klaus Mager: You know, from the farmer to the consumer, and the entire supply chain in between.

139
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.820
Klaus Mager: You know, the AI…

140
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:30.589
Klaus Mager: that we have, you know, I'm not allowed to say training, but configured, was actually a funny thing. My AI…

141
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:42.830
Klaus Mager: objected to me, saying that I'm training it. Just, no, no, you are… this is a configuration process, not a training process. Okay, fine, whatever, but,

142
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:58.750
Klaus Mager: We, we, we… I mean, I have, you know, configured now 6 agents that are starting with the farmer, that are going through the, the, moving, moving product from the farm to…

143
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:08.280
Klaus Mager: the… to the market, and then the market, and so on. Anyway, it's, it's a… it's a total systems reconfiguration process.

144
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.350
Klaus Mager: And it's very difficult to get traction, because the…

145
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:32.369
Klaus Mager: The regenerative movement is so splendid, you know, you have so many groups everywhere doing something, and they're all doing good work, but it's not scalable, it's self-contained, it doesn't share, you know, learnings in an organized fashion.

146
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:41.949
Klaus Mager: So that's, you know, where, where I've been, hoping to, to, to engage,

147
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.690
Klaus Mager: Because the AI that… the way this thing can work is…

148
00:21:47.840 --> 00:22:04.360
Klaus Mager: that you don't need to have, like, a massive database. If we can get anybody who wants to work within the regenerative frame to just use a few keywords in their website, you know, in their materials.

149
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:11.749
Klaus Mager: the AI will find you, right? So if we are working within, let's say, a bioregion.

150
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:27.610
Klaus Mager: let's say a community high desert of bend, or anywhere, really, anyone who wants to participate just needs to, say, put some keywords out there, and the AI will find you, know what you're doing.

151
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:36.360
Klaus Mager: So anyway, I'm… I'm… I finally got, our first project here. It's a course called Aqual Regenerations.

152
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:49.350
Klaus Mager: I'm hopefully not violating any rules here, Cherry, but here is the group that we're working with, so we actually have our kickoff meeting later today.

153
00:22:49.510 --> 00:23:02.839
Klaus Mager: they already… this is another scrappy startup. They are highly ambitious in a way of creating tools to assist small farmers, and they are headquartered in Kenya.

154
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:09.139
Klaus Mager: They currently have 40 locations, with groups of farmers signed up.

155
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:18.479
Klaus Mager: And, we decided to partner where I provide the back of house, intelligence system.

156
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:37.520
Klaus Mager: also my own skill set, really, because I need to guide them into what type of data they need to source from these farmers and from the farm support, supporting groups, so that we can then work with this. But,

157
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:54.090
Klaus Mager: it's… it's a, you know, regenerative system transformation. They are… they are appealing to the United Nations and to, I mean, groups linked to the UN and others to get funding, so we are, you know, doing a joint funding launch.

158
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.610
Klaus Mager: So we'll see where that goes, but… the…

159
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:09.099
Klaus Mager: The challenge that I see, really, is that the industrial sector, where the money really sits, is doubling down and doing the same damn thing.

160
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:22.329
Klaus Mager: just with more emphasis. You know, you see the same thing that you see in the energy sector, where they're cutting out wind and solar and batteries and all? You see the same in food now.

161
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:33.040
Klaus Mager: Where we are saying you need to stop taking… using these GMO seeds, you need to stop using all these chemicals to grow food, and then they're doing the opposite, they're doubling down on it.

162
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:44.439
Klaus Mager: So, I don't know, it's… it seems to be… it seems to be, you know, a tough slug to… to, convince people to…

163
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:54.910
Klaus Mager: to join. I'm trying to get something launched here in my own backyard in the high desert of Bend. And now I'm…

164
00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:09.750
Klaus Mager: I'm connected now with some people who retired here. There's one guy who stepped up into our advisory team. He's a retired Salesforce executive, and he was pretty high up in Salesforce, and…

165
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:15.449
Klaus Mager: You know, he has, you know, looked at what we're doing, and he wants to help us to launch.

166
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.220
Klaus Mager: And… and get organized, so…

167
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:27.200
Klaus Mager: the story resonates, you know, we have been able to… to,

168
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:43.859
Klaus Mager: To get, you know, folks interested in doing it, but the people who are on the ground and who are working day intensely on a day-to-day basis have a very difficult time to see how they can integrate with us.

169
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.919
Klaus Mager: And how that would make sense.

170
00:25:47.870 --> 00:26:06.190
Klaus Mager: So, it's, I mean, it's extremely disturbing, you know, to watch this political process, because it's just so painful to, to see the damage these guys are doing, you know, to, to, on a civilizational level,

171
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.750
Klaus Mager: And, and, and how,

172
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.459
Klaus Mager: how there is just no collective response. I mean, there is just…

173
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:24.780
Klaus Mager: Scattered opinions and scattered efforts, community-based, nothing that has any chance of scaling so far.

174
00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.579
Klaus Mager: Yeah, so anyway, that's where I'm at.

175
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.930
Rick Botelho: Yeah, I'd like… go ahead, Sean, go ahead.

176
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.230
Shawn Murphy: No, no, go ahead, go ahead.

177
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:58.430
Rick Botelho: There are two themes that I want to touch on. One was Kevin, about what's happening in Asheville in terms of the inequities

178
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.460
Rick Botelho: The systemic inequities that are baked into the system.

179
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:11.370
Rick Botelho: And Klaus, you were talking a moment ago about the fact they're, they're, you know, within the regenerative movement, they're splintered.

180
00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:20.319
Rick Botelho: I don't think that splintering is unique to that movement, it's all over the place, and that's part of the problem of, bringing people together.

181
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:26.339
Rick Botelho: To take on the systemic psychopathy that we're living through, and the systemic prejudice

182
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:39.559
Rick Botelho: against equity. You know, people have heard me talk about this before, about equity metagovance as a way of thinking about how to bring people together over the process rather than the content.

183
00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:45.290
Rick Botelho: We have so much content out there that we're not very good at handling the process of the content.

184
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:52.980
Rick Botelho: And last week's session on sense-making, the thing that came up for me Was the notion of co-intelligence.

185
00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.900
Rick Botelho: And two nights ago, I decided to take the plunge.

186
00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.010
Rick Botelho: And, spend 200 bucks for one month.

187
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:13.489
Rick Botelho: on Perplexity AI to see whether it's really worth getting access to the additional resources that you might be able to do through it, because I'm fascinated about the whole issue of co-intelligence.

188
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:31.360
Rick Botelho: And, you know, I remember a while back, Scott, if he's listening, you know, looked at one of my questions and says, oh, it's too complex, and, you know, he sort of thought about it, whatever. And, you know, one of the things that I've, I've become really interested in is how

189
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:38.679
Rick Botelho: how we can actually… there is a sort of, I'm gonna exaggerate this for the sake of making a point.

190
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:46.829
Rick Botelho: that we're actually living with the, the cult indoctrination of a KISS principle.

191
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:55.890
Rick Botelho: And I mentioned the KSSS principle before, in terms of keeping sophistication, this side of simplicity, and we talked about this last time, Kraus.

192
00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:13.159
Rick Botelho: Although I think the integral framework is incredibly useful, but I think literacy level, comprehension level, is adequate. If you want to go in the spiritual domain, absolutely, it's a useful framework for thinking about different levels of consciousness, but in terms of trying to bring people together.

193
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.539
Rick Botelho: I mean, I think that's the biggest challenge.

194
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:23.459
Rick Botelho: Anyway, this is a bit of a popcery of comments here, because on Labor Day, I went to the Labor Day parade.

195
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:34.400
Rick Botelho: And a friend of mine was actually carrying the flag of the McDems, and, you know, Mark Kelly was supposed to be in the, you know, doing an event there.

196
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:44.920
Rick Botelho: With them. And I, I joined him, I put my hand around him, he says, hey, where's Mark Kelly? He says, he's over there. And I said, okay. I went over and had a chat with him.

197
00:29:45.030 --> 00:30:01.179
Rick Botelho: Which is a, you know, just an opportunistic thing. And I spoke with him, and he put me in contact with his, administrative assistants, and I said, I've got some ideas, are you open to him? He says, yeah, here's my administrator. So anyway, I just got a text message back from the administrative

198
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.919
Rick Botelho: assistant saying, he was going to share what I, had, had worked on.

199
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.330
Rick Botelho: And,

200
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:23.290
Rick Botelho: So I, you know, you know, people say I haven't been listening to the fact that people are saying the same things. I have been listening, actually, but you don't know how deeply I've been listening, or how I'm responding to it, because I haven't had a response to do it.

201
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:32.720
Rick Botelho: So, when… when we go, open, I can share, I did a deep dive using Perplexity, looking at this whole phenomena.

202
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:44.279
Rick Botelho: of, this KISS indoctrination that we're entrapped with, and it's a splintering reductionist framework that makes it very difficult to deal with, complexity.

203
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:54.750
Rick Botelho: And so it goes against the grain, and we have to have new learning methods to be able to actually get people to collaborate across their divisions.

204
00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:11.939
Rick Botelho: And I think I mentioned I'm involved in… I've backed off of working with Indivisible, because they're suffering with the same problem. They're divided. They can't get their act together either. And they're not good at having conflict. They don't know how to have healthy disagreement.

205
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:17.790
Rick Botelho: And some of the most successful change movers are the ones that actually Work it out.

206
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.070
Rick Botelho: The fact that there is huge differences within

207
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:36.009
Rick Botelho: the sort of progressive movement, you have to work it out. But people get so wrapped up in their little rabbit holes that they start, you know, squabbling amongst themselves in a way that doesn't advance the cause. Anyway.

208
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.750
Rick Botelho: So,

209
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:48.729
Rick Botelho: I just wanted to chime in there with the two themes that Kevin and Thao alluded to, and provide a different perspective to that. And on that note, I'm done speaking.

210
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:06.950
Shawn Murphy: I'm finding myself going deep on, on… on…

211
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:22.319
Shawn Murphy: Trying to really, really understand the… the… micro… level of… cognitive… interactions… intercognitive interactions twixt humans.

212
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:26.610
Shawn Murphy: As it relates to conversation.

213
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:36.930
Shawn Murphy: And the elaboration of people's, understandings and mental models during, conversational interactions.

214
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:43.960
Shawn Murphy: And interleaving those growing appreciations with

215
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:48.310
Shawn Murphy: An understanding of what the technical

216
00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:59.260
Shawn Murphy: a low-level technical architecture needs to be, for a… an intercognitive, framework for,

217
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.589
Shawn Murphy: Yeah, capturing that.

218
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.460
Shawn Murphy: Traffic.

219
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:12.779
Shawn Murphy: To support, both synchronous and asynchronous, enhancement.

220
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.470
Shawn Murphy: With machine support.

221
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:30.149
Shawn Murphy: Yeah, I, really love Kevin's remark about, about the watersheds, being more manageable. In effect,

222
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:40.569
Shawn Murphy: The, the automatic, self-organizing character of, of watershed maintenance when people can communicate, gracefully.

223
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:53.119
Shawn Murphy: And, and I think that, that kind of… That kind of…

224
00:33:53.460 --> 00:34:03.430
Shawn Murphy: Clean, self-organizing, beauty in, and…

225
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:10.320
Shawn Murphy: Intercognitive, in the intercognitive domain, is really…

226
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.400
Shawn Murphy: Where the great hope is for us.

227
00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:13.969
Shawn Murphy: Forever.

228
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.820
Jose Leal: So maybe I'll, I'll jump in.

229
00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:02.980
Jose Leal: It's been a while since I've done a check-in. It's probably been 2 or 3 months.

230
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:09.770
Jose Leal: I've, recently lost my business partner. He,

231
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.829
Jose Leal: He died, about a month ago.

232
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:20.810
Jose Leal: It's been a slow… process. He's… he was diagnosed with colon cancer.

233
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.329
Jose Leal: Stage 4, maybe about a year and a half, two years ago.

234
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:32.029
Jose Leal: So that's been a, a long road for him, for us, our community.

235
00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:40.039
Jose Leal: And, I've come to, sort of… Realize that it's a…

236
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.670
Jose Leal: sort of a double-edged sword. You know that it's gonna happen.

237
00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.240
Jose Leal: So it, you, it kind of…

238
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:57.030
Jose Leal: Slows you down, you don't want to rock the boat, you don't want to sort of start moving ahead without him,

239
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:04.789
Jose Leal: And then, at the same time, you're… you sort of feel this angst about, feeling, sort of…

240
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:13.599
Jose Leal: held back in some way. It's kind of… kind of a crazy thing, and so there's this… all of a sudden, there's this sense of…

241
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.440
Jose Leal: Sort of… release.

242
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:24.300
Jose Leal: And guilt all at the same time. It's very interesting, sensations.

243
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:35.840
Jose Leal: Meanwhile, The projects have continued, the… the work on…

244
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:52.309
Jose Leal: sort of our version of Neobooks, I've updated Jerry on that, has progressed. I'm pretty excited about this idea of a neobook being not only an open platform.

245
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:59.629
Jose Leal: Where the content is open source and editable, and people can contribute to it, and so on and so forth.

246
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.040
Jose Leal: But that it be, multimodal.

247
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:18.069
Jose Leal: Meaning, that, it's not just text, but audio, memes, video, presentations, and that all three, all of those layers,

248
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.729
Jose Leal: are actually related to one another, so the same…

249
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.890
Jose Leal: Type of content in text, say a paragraph.

250
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:44.540
Jose Leal: Might be reduced to, a meme, or, to a slide, or two, or, to audio in the form of a… typically an audiobook, or even a podcast component. And that all of these things are,

251
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.729
Jose Leal: you can… Go in and out of these layers.

252
00:38:48.870 --> 00:39:04.900
Jose Leal: As a consumer of it. And by consumer, I don't mean purchaser, but a user. And so we're mocking a lot of this stuff up, both at the technical level.

253
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.600
Jose Leal: And that the, at the content level.

254
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.700
Jose Leal: We're developing something we call, a life fingerprint.

255
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:22.919
Jose Leal: That tries to model what's happening in this content?

256
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:31.980
Jose Leal: From a life perspective, what… What layer of complexity is… is acting and, and,

257
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:37.290
Jose Leal: Trying to get it down to a root level of definition.

258
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:56.550
Jose Leal: So that this content can actually be related, not simply by the words, cue terms, and so on and so forth, by the actual life flows that are happening within the content, or being described within the content. So, that feels powerful.

259
00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.179
Jose Leal: Really complex, really difficult, but,

260
00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:04.050
Jose Leal: Feels like a good exploration and a good direction to go.

261
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.299
Jose Leal: Ken was part of some of this work early on.

262
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:14.449
Jose Leal: And and we've continued that work of understanding some of that,

263
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:23.470
Jose Leal: life functions, and what these life functions do in context, and so forth. So that's… that's one of the projects. The first…

264
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:29.630
Jose Leal: thing that we're developing as a neobook in this context. We're doing these two things in parallel.

265
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.519
Jose Leal: Is serving life.

266
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.230
Jose Leal: And serving life is,

267
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:45.070
Jose Leal: the first neobook in this model. I know we have Neobooks in, the…

268
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:55.519
Jose Leal: another model of neobooks, which is just text. But this model where we have the multiple layers and the interactions and so forth.

269
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.449
Jose Leal: Serving Life, we… we hope to be the first book. So that…

270
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:07.149
Jose Leal: piece of it is, progressing well. We now have…

271
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:11.039
Jose Leal: Some new case studies,

272
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:18.149
Jose Leal: we've recently interviewed Kevin, for… for that.

273
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:24.339
Jose Leal: Hunter Levins recently, we interviewed, Alan.

274
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.669
Jose Leal: Savory from the, the Savory Institute, as well.

275
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:38.739
Jose Leal: A number of others in the space that are folks that we believe are moving towards… excuse me…

276
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:45.040
Jose Leal: Moving towards this new… Way of operating that recognizes that

277
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.399
Jose Leal: what we do is serving life. Sorry.

278
00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:58.620
Jose Leal: And so… that model is,

279
00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.080
Jose Leal: It's progressing well, the book's starting to feel like a book.

280
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.280
Jose Leal: In a clear narrative, at least we think so. We've had a few readers give us some really good feedback on it.

281
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:18.379
Jose Leal: And, we're hopeful that we can wrap this up by the end of the year.

282
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:26.300
Jose Leal: Whether it will be in the form of an e-book at that point, we're not sure, but at the very least, we'll have the content ready.

283
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.169
Jose Leal: For it to integrate into it, and…

284
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:37.209
Jose Leal: And our vision is that anyone who's writing, who's seriously creating a book nowadays, Is going to be…

285
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:46.569
Jose Leal: doing memes, they're going to be doing presentations, they're going to be doing audio versions of it. And that all of these things have to exist anyway.

286
00:42:46.670 --> 00:43:01.679
Jose Leal: And so why not integrate them into one experience that, people can engage, do deep dives down into the… not only the text, but the supporting, data that's behind it?

287
00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.109
Jose Leal: And… and do superficial, just…

288
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:10.569
Jose Leal: Float through the memes, or, float through the presentations.

289
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:26.490
Jose Leal: and at any time, do a deep dive into the material below it. So that's… feels exciting to… to think of a new model of experiencing content, producing content, and having content be,

290
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:35.249
Jose Leal: available to folks that don't necessarily want to just read a book, traditionally, so…

291
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.990
Jose Leal: Much more to update, but I'll leave it at that, because that's a pretty long update as it is. Thank you.

292
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.330
Scott Moehring: I think I'll go next, because it kind of…

293
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.720
Scott Moehring: dovetails with what you were saying, Jose. So…

294
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:23.190
Scott Moehring: Last week, we were talking about… collective intelligence.

295
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:29.959
Scott Moehring: And I've been thinking about the nature of collaboration for a couple of years, because I think it's…

296
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:37.730
Scott Moehring: I'm having a hard time finding great examples of it, which says to me that I think it's more limited than we say.

297
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.349
Scott Moehring: I've started to think of it as…

298
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:46.879
Scott Moehring: Working separately, then coming together to share, and then working separately again.

299
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:54.410
Scott Moehring: I'm… I'm trying to find… examples where… A group of pre… well…

300
00:44:54.730 --> 00:45:01.850
Scott Moehring: A group of people get together and actually collaborate in a sense where it's not One or two working

301
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.440
Scott Moehring: and others… Being in the room.

302
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:15.759
Scott Moehring: And… I think what I've… I even looked at an electronic musician who…

303
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:28.319
Scott Moehring: Has been in the game for 40 years, and he did a collaboration project. And the way it was done was that he would set up some tunes, send the digital file to the other person.

304
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.289
Scott Moehring: They would modify it, send it back to him.

305
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:38.940
Scott Moehring: He would modify it, and they would go back and forth until they had a musical piece that they liked.

306
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:45.889
Scott Moehring: And I… I think about things like Wikipedia, which is sort of at the opposite end. You have

307
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.309
Scott Moehring: It feels like a collaborative effort.

308
00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:54.660
Scott Moehring: And so it's just something I've been thinking about a lot, is what is the…

309
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.819
Scott Moehring: I think we throw around the word collaboration a lot.

310
00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:08.729
Scott Moehring: Without really being honest about what the work entails, and I will leave this with the last thought.

311
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:21.460
Scott Moehring: it's very different from being on a team, because I think just being on a team doesn't mean that you're collaborating, in my sense of it. It's more that…

312
00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:27.660
Scott Moehring: The genesis of the idea and the actual work is something that is…

313
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:36.560
Scott Moehring: two minds as one, sort of. And I've experienced it, but only… In fleeting moments where

314
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:50.690
Scott Moehring: My brain and someone else's brain are… are in… we both get it, and we're finishing each other's sentences… sentences and things like that, but it seems to me to be a rare thing that we keep seeking

315
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:57.059
Scott Moehring: We, meaning… I just see collaboration as a skill that…

316
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.929
Scott Moehring: People seem to want to develop.

317
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:05.550
Scott Moehring: and yet… maybe… It's not what we think it is, and so…

318
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:09.030
Scott Moehring: We're trying to create something that might not

319
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:13.760
Scott Moehring: actually be a way that people work together. So, that's my thought.

320
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:13.909
Jerry Michalski: I love our sharing of our projects and obsessions and scary life events like concussions and flooding.

321
00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:27.810
Jerry Michalski: and all these other sorts of things. Thank you for all for showing up wholeheartedly. You may hear it in my voice, but April and I have been down with a bug since about the 22nd of August, so it's been a while.

322
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:44.429
Jerry Michalski: And this feels like a familiar bug. April came back from a trip and basically brought it home, and I nursed her for a couple days, and then I came down with it. And for me, the day I came down with it, I put a marker two weeks later in my calendar, which is still next week, that said, is my bug gone?

323
00:49:44.560 --> 00:50:03.410
Jerry Michalski: Because in my experience, this is two weeks of coughing miserably, hacking up phlegm. In this case, like, my right eye is all tiered up, so apparently there's a bacterial infection that's accompanying this, that moves from eye to eye or something, and I don't know what, but it's like a couple very uncomfortable nights, but we can work, we can do stuff.

324
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:11.490
Jerry Michalski: Luckily, we don't have any performances that we have to miss because we're sick or anything like that, so it's all good. But we've been feeling kind of low.

325
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:19.620
Jerry Michalski: Hank Kuhn, who's not here today, but who is a frequenter of OGM, and I have had a couple calls around UpKeto.

326
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:27.870
Jerry Michalski: Which got mentioned somewhere, I don't remember where it showed up, but Hank was like, I love this idea of keto idea, let's talk. So we've had a couple of separate calls.

327
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:39.640
Jerry Michalski: Up keto is a neologism, it is a concatenation of upward spiral, or uplift, and Aikido, which is my sport. And, we've talked about Aikido a few times

328
00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:51.530
Jerry Michalski: a few times in OGM, but Up Keto is just meant to be a practice. At this point, it's a thought experiment. Like, what would a practice be like if your intention was to improve everything you touch?

329
00:50:52.930 --> 00:51:05.680
Jerry Michalski: to help upward spiral happen all over the time, with Aikido principles, meaning not coming in and bludgeoning things, but blending with sensing the energies, blending with, and then seeing what improvement went. And improve

330
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:14.449
Jerry Michalski: is the best word I've been able to find for it so far, but it's a really touchy word, because what I think might be an improvement of the situation might piss everybody off.

331
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:19.849
Jerry Michalski: Et cetera, et cetera. And then there are knock-on effects and so forth. So you've got to be thoughtful about this. But…

332
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:29.309
Jerry Michalski: But putting a… cracking a joke, or listening to the cashier at the store and cracking a joke and putting a smile on their face is up keto.

333
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:42.940
Jerry Michalski: Free hugs is up keto, and kind of non-controversial, because people can choose to walk up and hug you or not, whatever. But this notion that you might walk around and try to make everything better that you touch, I like a lot.

334
00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:50.529
Jerry Michalski: And so, there's a baby… there's a fledgling website at UpKeto.com, but we started talking, and then I sat down with Claude.

335
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:54.779
Jerry Michalski: Not my friend Claude, but rather the new Alien Intelligence Claude.

336
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.630
Jerry Michalski: and posed some of these things to Claude, and Claude was, like, wonderful about this, and OMG, holy hell.

337
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:20.270
Jerry Michalski: you know, folded and asked a couple different questions, grew the whole thing, and I'm like, oh, this is really pretty good, I like this a ton. So expect to see some of that at some point. And so Hank and I, I created a private group on LinkedIn, if anybody wants to talk about UpKeto, when we released the town's

338
00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:25.229
Jerry Michalski: of chat at the end of the check-in, I will post that link in the chat.

339
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:32.049
Jerry Michalski: So that we can sort of figure this thing out, and formulate it, and propagate it, and do whatever… whatever…

340
00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:38.349
Jerry Michalski: whatever it wants to be, I'm really interested in helping it become, as long as it's not evil. Ha.

341
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:43.600
Jerry Michalski: Because I think the general concept… then maybe it needs a secret handshake.

342
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:54.539
Jerry Michalski: or a little pin or something that you, you know, you wear, I don't know, so that you know that, oh, this is an upkedo practitioner, they should be careful, they're a master of the dark arts of Apikido.

343
00:52:54.870 --> 00:53:12.599
Jerry Michalski: I think things like this ought also be, like, fun, and slightly conspiratorial is okay. And then I realized also in the framing of UpKeto that there are some principles of UpKeto, and that they overlapped heavily, heavily, heavily with my principles of design from trust.

344
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:20.610
Jerry Michalski: that I've been formulating Design from Trust for a while, but lately I've been focusing on writing out, and will soon be posting.

345
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:24.760
Jerry Michalski: My method of posting is so fucking slow, because

346
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:39.529
Jerry Michalski: I… I write out the tendrils of an octopus of an idea, and then I need to finish all the tendrils before I post the main idea, because you're gonna go out to all the different little tendrils, and I… it gets complicated, and it winds up a little hard to finish, but…

347
00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:45.130
Jerry Michalski: I'll post a link to the Principles of Design for Trust, which start with the very simple, assume good faith.

348
00:53:45.200 --> 00:54:03.050
Jerry Michalski: Or good intent, whichever word you prefer. But assume good faith is, like, the grounding principle of design from trust, and it's a nice principle for Akido as well. And there's a bunch of others. In particular, in my brain, there's a thought of inspirations for the principles of design from trust.

349
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:14.070
Jerry Michalski: which points to a, I think at this point, very beautiful curated collection of other prints… other useful groups of principles from other groups around the world.

350
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:23.339
Jerry Michalski: that are awesome, that are just wonderful. So I've been borrowing from some of those and figuring out, like, what this might look like. But, anybody who's interested.

351
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:33.260
Jerry Michalski: join the group, or get in touch, or whatever, but it's been really fun to think about these things, because I'm trying… last thought, I'm trying really hard to figure out

352
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.900
Jerry Michalski: Positive things to be and do.

353
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:39.459
Jerry Michalski: At this particular moment of multiple crises.

354
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:51.199
Jerry Michalski: I'm trying to figure out a bunch of ways to walk into the world, like, that might attract people to go, yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to build, I want to do, I want to improve. And this is just… this is one of them.

355
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:56.399
Jerry Michalski: So, with that, I am… Today, so far. Complete.

356
00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:02.719
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So I found myself in a space of emptying out.

357
00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:09.820
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: We have our appointment at the Spanish Consulate, a week and a half from…

358
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:19.029
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Now. Been going through the house, downsizing, selling stuff off, going through my life, going through my memories,

359
00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:28.329
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And I know that there's a new adventure coming, but right now it's about… Letting things go.

360
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:31.350
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And it's painful.

361
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:40.620
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And, and it feels somehow appropriate to the times in which I live, that so much is passing.

362
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:49.310
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: trying to honor things that, have been a part of my life, both the good and the bad, and the ugly. So,

363
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:55.539
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I'm just in a very interesting place that I'm not used to being in.

364
00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:05.320
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: when I took my coaching course 25 years ago, I was that…

365
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:22.219
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: If you know the Zen story about the professor who went to meet the Zen master, and the professor's talking and talking, the Zen Master's pouring the tea into the cup until it's overflowing, if you need to empty your mind out, and the first thing I was assigned after being given a bunch of books was, MediaFast, you need to just let yourself settle.

366
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.919
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So I'm in that space right now of letting things settle… again.

367
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:34.980
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And not trying to take new things in, but to just honor what's gone before, and release it with grace.

368
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:37.459
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Which is not easy.

369
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:45.300
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: has a lot of poignancy. I've been in Marin County for 35 years, and I'm looking at leaving here in the next…

370
00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:57.170
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: between 3 and 6 months, and it's becoming very real. Someone came and bought all my CDs this… this past week. 980 CDs gone from my living room. It's like…

371
00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:02.209
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: it's naked in here, you know? And I have someone coming to look at my book collection, and…

372
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:04.830
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So it's getting really very real.

373
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:10.169
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Because we're not gonna bring a lot of stuff with us. We're bringing, you know, cookware.

374
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.150
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Got it, my cast iron pans, and my pots, and my knives.

375
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:19.390
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Clothing and artwork, and everything else is going by the wayside.

376
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.520
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So…

377
00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:31.309
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I was not a Zen practitioner, I was a Vipassana practitioner, but my life is becoming very Zen, of how do I just release this, and…

378
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:45.799
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: live a simpler way, which also feels appropriate to moving into the last phase of my life, the third act, you know? This is… this is it, this is the last hurrah, you know? Moving to new culture, new country, new language, new people.

379
00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:56.730
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And I find that's giving me a strange detachment to what's going on in this country right now, because I am completely and totally outraged.

380
00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:01.320
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And completely and totally… Devastated?

381
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:06.780
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Like, how the hell did this happen? And where?

382
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:12.019
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Is the collective response that says, fuck no!

383
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:13.970
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Not seeing it.

384
01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:24.659
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And if I were not leaving, I'd be a lot more involved, but I am leaving, and so it's like, okay, I don't… I don't have the bandwidth right now to be too involved in that.

385
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.549
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And I feel some guilt about that, you know?

386
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.129
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I love this country.

387
01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.899
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: all of everything that I was gifted. I'm aware of how much of it came on the backs of

388
01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.480
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Exploitation of both land and people elsewhere, but…

389
01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:43.920
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: You know, I've had a really great life here, as has…

390
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.809
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: you know, so many people that I know, and…

391
01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:54.470
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: that seems to be dissolving, and maybe that's what's needed, you know? Civilization, as Gandhi said, is a great idea. I'm not seeing it.

392
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:57.890
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: We're not being very civil here these days.

393
01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:00.180
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And,

394
01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:06.679
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I'm very concerned about what's gonna happen, and I want to be far away, as things continue to slide

395
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.899
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: More and more, increasingly, accelerated downhill.

396
01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:17.430
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So there's just a whole lot of shit going on, at multiple levels.

397
01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:18.980
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And…

398
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:28.829
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I'm glad I have my practices, you know, to create the space to hold this and not be overwhelmed by it.

399
01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:33.470
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And I'm glad I have people in my life to talk to, so that I don't get,

400
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:42.670
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: too overwhelmed by it, but I am overwhelmed by it, you know? It's… it's… there's only so much I can let in and handle before I have to say.

401
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.110
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Enough.

402
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:45.970
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: -Oh.

403
01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:50.849
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And the emptying out feels like part of that process of, in order to be able to

404
01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:56.349
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: hold what's going on in the world, I have to queer out a bunch of shit from my life.

405
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.740
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Physically and internally.

406
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.739
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So, that's what's… Going on with me these days?

407
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:26.740
John Warinner: But, if I can jump in here, I've, sincerely apologize for coming in late.

408
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.059
John Warinner: From a few things that have been said.

409
01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.659
John Warinner: I feel like I missed one of the main things I would have liked to have heard, which was Kevin talking about watersheds.

410
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:41.779
John Warinner: But what Ken just said reminded me

411
01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:46.849
John Warinner: About a year ago, I was out in North Carolina. I live in Oregon.

412
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.350
John Warinner: very rarely get to North Carolina.

413
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:53.459
John Warinner: But since I was there, with a little bit of time to spare.

414
01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:58.130
John Warinner: I looked up Kevin and reached out to him and asked him if I could

415
01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.330
John Warinner: Come meet him in person.

416
01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:09.060
John Warinner: he and I had a really nice, chat on the banks of the Swananoa River… on his property.

417
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.869
John Warinner: And, what sticks in my mind

418
01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:16.900
John Warinner: was Kevin mentioned, the concept of retreat.

419
01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.289
John Warinner: Kinda like,

420
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:26.389
John Warinner: prompting me a little bit, like, hey, is this a… is this a topic that you and I should pick up on, and…

421
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:33.500
John Warinner: bring to OGM, given our shared interest in watersheds and water and hydrology and whatnot.

422
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.709
John Warinner: But, Ken, what you just said…

423
01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.619
John Warinner: Strikes me, you know, like, so often.

424
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.759
John Warinner: We look at the world around us, and we…

425
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:47.750
John Warinner: We notice the changes that everyone else needs to make.

426
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:53.139
John Warinner: But this letting go that you're doing.

427
01:03:54.060 --> 01:04:00.190
John Warinner: Seems to me like it's exactly what we all need to be doing. Maybe not literally, like, the same way.

428
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:04.149
John Warinner: But I think… I think this purging and letting go

429
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:12.429
John Warinner: and you're doing it at a very, very complete level, you know, it sounds like, and I think that's wonderful. Like, I see that as being…

430
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.760
John Warinner: like, like, almost what's necessary for rebirth.

431
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:26.149
John Warinner: Because we can… we can conceptually say, like, we're being reborn or whatever, you know, but if we're staying in the same domicile with all the same…

432
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.430
John Warinner: You know, trappings, and belongings, and friends, and… And everything else,

433
01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.170
John Warinner: you know, we're really not giving up anything, right? Like, we're just…

434
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.989
John Warinner: We're just holding on to what we have.

435
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:43.369
John Warinner: And, as John Mayer says, waiting for the world to change.

436
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:49.640
John Warinner: So, I just want to applaud, you know, like, what I hear what I hear you saying…

437
01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:52.549
John Warinner: Including the stepping into the…

438
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:59.059
John Warinner: you know, the void, or the vortex, or whatever that comes with that, right? Like…

439
01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:02.960
John Warinner: Yeah, like, if you're gonna… if you're gonna truly…

440
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:06.670
John Warinner: Let go, and release, and… and…

441
01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:12.889
John Warinner: you know, whether you call it a Zen practice, right, like, whatever label you put on it, right? Like…

442
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.380
John Warinner: I think… I think you're doing…

443
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:22.840
John Warinner: I think you're doing… and I'll just extend that to… I feel like each person that I've heard talk, like Josue, and…

444
01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:28.340
John Warinner: I came on when Klaus was in the middle of his deal, so I don't know that I heard it all.

445
01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.960
John Warinner: But then, Jerry, what he said, I feel like every single person

446
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:37.570
John Warinner: That has spoken this morning, has spoken to me, in a way, of…

447
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:44.889
John Warinner: like, everything you've said has resonated with a piece of what I am personally doing and going through and working through.

448
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:54.350
John Warinner: And so I guess I just want to say, like, we're doing it, you know? Like, each of us, in our own way, we're doing what we need to do.

449
01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.880
John Warinner: And maybe… maybe the number one ingredient that… that…

450
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.200
John Warinner: That needs to accompany all that is the…

451
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:08.690
John Warinner: okay-ness with it, right? Like, the… the letting go…

452
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.449
John Warinner: So that… so that we can see, like, you know, on the panarchy curve, this is the…

453
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.779
John Warinner: This is the collapse, or the deconstruction, or the…

454
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:25.079
John Warinner: whatever you want to call it, that has to precede reconstruction. Like, you can't… you can't reconstruct

455
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.469
John Warinner: And hold everything… everything that we were already…

456
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:36.149
John Warinner: you know, all our norms or whatever, we can't hold all those constant and reconstruct, you know? It's like…

457
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:42.829
John Warinner: Reconstruction has to arise from some degree of Disruption and dissolution, and…

458
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:47.300
John Warinner: Anyway, so I just, like, feeling super grateful for…

459
01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:57.040
John Warinner: for calling in when I did, and… and yeah, regretful that I… that I missed part of what was said here, but, yeah, just thanks… thanks for everybody, and…

460
01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:01.509
John Warinner: I say, Ken, you know, like, more power to you, man. I think you're doing a great thing.

461
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:17.389
Mike Nelson: I can give a real quick report from Washington, D.C. I really apologize for being late. I was in a meeting on the future of data policy, global, and…

462
01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:20.389
Mike Nelson: Seemed important, and it was.

463
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.659
Mike Nelson: I won't spend much time on the political.

464
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:32.480
Mike Nelson: You've all been reading both the news and the analysis of the news.

465
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:41.549
Mike Nelson: A lot of the posts I see are trying to decide whether this is the end of democracy, or just another

466
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:56.840
Mike Nelson: Donald Trump and family con job. But anyway, I won't go there. It is causing a great deal of depression, a lot of people staying up late at night, or waking up in the middle of the night, and

467
01:08:57.330 --> 01:09:04.009
Mike Nelson: trying to make sense of it, or perhaps figure out what they should do. On my own side,

468
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:08.490
Mike Nelson: I just got back from Manila and Taipei, had a…

469
01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:15.980
Mike Nelson: very eventful and absolutely fascinating conversation opportunity there to meet some new people.

470
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.340
Mike Nelson: if anybody has heard of the HIRA, Network.

471
01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:37.169
Mike Nelson: H-Y-R-A, And I think their, website is Hira Tech, H-Y-R-A-T-E-C-K. They're based in Vietnam and Dubai, and

472
01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:46.799
Mike Nelson: They string together a lot of buzzwords. Initially, I was incredibly skeptical, because it was blockchain enabling edge computing for AI, you know?

473
01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:56.980
Mike Nelson: But they're doing something with that, and they have a vision, and they have some smart people involved, so I'd be interested in anybody's,

474
01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.649
Mike Nelson: Take on that.

475
01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:11.369
Mike Nelson: On the personal side, I've been dealing with some strange symptoms lately, and, met with a neurologist and a neurosurgeon, and

476
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:20.169
Mike Nelson: this is one of these gray zones where you really can't figure out what's going on. I also learned I had Lyme disease.

477
01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:23.780
Mike Nelson: Either… A month ago, or 10 years ago.

478
01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:33.060
Mike Nelson: Which can cause neurological issues. But, anyway, we're doing some tests, and we're trying to struggle through that. I'm a…

479
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:50.209
Mike Nelson: firm believer in medical science. I just don't like to have to use it. And when the numbers are like, well, we could do this, and there's an 80% chance, and oh, we don't really know what's causing this.

480
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.729
Mike Nelson: I get skeptical, and I get anxious. So, that's sort of where I'm at. I will keep you informed maybe in a month.

481
01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:15.079
Mike Nelson: If we learn more. I'm also headed to the northern… to the Dolomites in northern Italy in about 10 days, and very much looking forward to spending a week with my wife and four of our best friends, hiking among

482
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:21.109
Mike Nelson: some of the most beautiful scenery in Italy, which, of course, says it a lot.

483
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:29.930
Mike Nelson: And I have a quick stop in Zurich, and might see my… The family that my… mothers…

484
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:36.150
Mike Nelson: grandfather left behind when he left, central Switzerland to come to Minnesota.

485
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:42.170
Mike Nelson: Anyway, that's where I'm at, and we live in interesting times.

486
01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.269
Mike Nelson: And thanks for all the things that people are posting on the list. It's,

487
01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.739
Mike Nelson: It's quite a grab bag.

488
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:55.709
Jerry Michalski: Mike, thank you.

489
01:11:55.810 --> 01:12:03.210
Jerry Michalski: I think that concludes the check-in round. Doug and Stacy said in the chat that they are good to go.

490
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.900
Jerry Michalski: I think we've heard from everybody, so I'm going to, release the hounds.

491
01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:13.589
Jerry Michalski: and see what we'd like to talk about. I will put in links,

492
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:18.019
Jerry Michalski: to… oh, that's right, Scott! My apologies. Where's Scott?

493
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.180
Scott Moehring: I'm right here.

494
01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.850
Jerry Michalski: Did you check in?

495
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:25.220
Scott Moehring: Yes, I did. I talked about collaboration.

496
01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.290
Jerry Michalski: I thought you did, that's right, good.

497
01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.919
Scott Moehring: I'm all covered, thank you.

498
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.199
Jerry Michalski: That collaboration may not be the thing we think it is.

499
01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.260
Scott Moehring: Correct, yes.

500
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:36.560
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, and I'd love to talk more about that. I had a brief question for Klaus.

501
01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:45.360
Jerry Michalski: Which was, I created recently in my brain two thoughts, basically things that RFK might fix.

502
01:12:45.500 --> 01:13:01.570
Jerry Michalski: at HHS, and things that RFK is fucking up at HHS. And the list of things that he's fucking up include vaccines, research, medical research, data, there's a whole mess of them. But things he might fix are things that I think we would broadly agree with him on.

503
01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:05.700
Jerry Michalski: About, you know, microplastics in the water supply, endocrine disruptors.

504
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:11.809
Jerry Michalski: food dyes, whatever, whatever. And I'm wondering, Klaus, is there a way for even Sierra Club

505
01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.220
Jerry Michalski: To pick a couple of the things that are on the not-the-naughty list, but the good list.

506
01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.690
Jerry Michalski: And just push hard to make those things happen.

507
01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:28.100
Jerry Michalski: just make sure the hell that the food… the food system doesn't resist as much, and that some of these things get done, because some of what I've been reading is that

508
01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:45.179
Jerry Michalski: there's very effective resistance by a lot of the big food companies to some of the efforts that… that RFK is trying to, you know, push through, so they're getting watered down, which is how this stuff often… all too often works. But I'm wondering if you break down… some of that stuff is, like, on… on…

509
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:47.160
Jerry Michalski: The progressive agenda as well.

510
01:13:48.500 --> 01:14:00.760
Klaus Mager: Well, I was one of the voices in the Sarah Club promoting Kennedy in the hope that, his ideas would

511
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:21.190
Klaus Mager: take hold, and there are now quite a few still hoping for that to happen, and lobbying in this, but I'm increasingly pessimistic. It seems like the industry is totally dominating the conversation.

512
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:31.320
Klaus Mager: So this, this whole idea of reducing the amount of highly processed foods, particularly towards children.

513
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:48.490
Klaus Mager: Which, you know, would have had impacts on the agricultural system, right? Because as you're reducing highly processed foods, that means you're reducing high fructose corn syrup, and

514
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:54.810
Klaus Mager: corn, based, processed foods, and so on.

515
01:14:55.090 --> 01:15:10.180
Klaus Mager: Yeah, no, the pushback is… is fierce, and the voices of Sierra Club and others are being drowned out here. I don't see it happening. I think this entire RFK.

516
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.569
Jerry Michalski: Phenomena is.

517
01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:17.300
Klaus Mager: It's, turning into a pile of, you-know-what.

518
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.679
Jerry Michalski: Alas. Yeah. Thanks, Klaus.

519
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:22.730
Jerry Michalski: Sean, please?

520
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:25.220
Shawn Murphy: Yeah.

521
01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:29.070
Kevin Jones: Can I jump in? Because I need to leave quickly and just have a quick statement.

522
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.939
Jerry Michalski: Go for it, Kevin.

523
01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:37.430
Kevin Jones: Yeah, Plex is a good thing. I'm willing to help keep it going if other people want to do that. You know, I just see it…

524
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:50.010
Kevin Jones: Back in my days as a community weekly newspaper editor, and the people from South Fulton would reach out to Miss Irma Estes, and she would say, their cousins motored in from Memphis, etc.

525
01:15:50.010 --> 01:16:11.679
Kevin Jones: And so I'm willing to help, you know, just do that, and also add that I would, you know, when people say things on this list, I may reach out to you to say, please say more about that, you know, like Scott, say more about collaboration or something. So I would add to what Pete did, but I don't want to do it myself.

526
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.090
Kevin Jones: But I want to be part of doing it, because it's something I like to do.

527
01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:21.530
Jerry Michalski: That sounds awesome, Kevin. I think that's energy Pete would welcome. He's been looking for people to sort of help collect.

528
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:36.709
Kevin Jones: Yeah, he wants… I can't make it into a Plex thing, but I could… I could reach out to folks and just do a, you know, twice-a-month community news from the open, gambling mind, or whatever we are.

529
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.130
Jerry Michalski: Lake Wobegon.

530
01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.079
Kevin Jones: From what's going on, yep. Okay.

531
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:45.129
Jerry Michalski: And all the children are above average. Now, back to you, Smurp.

532
01:16:45.550 --> 01:17:05.099
Shawn Murphy: Hello there. I would just, just like to comment on the, on the delicious, complexity slash plight that, human beings in general, and us in this group are, suffering from, of, of, this business about

533
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:23.479
Shawn Murphy: identifying when we're talking about the same thing, and when we're talking about different things, and how to even manage to distinguish those phenomena. Every single word that Jose said earlier.

534
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.519
Shawn Murphy: I could have said or have been sane for…

535
01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:40.280
Shawn Murphy: a decade. And, and so I say a decade because, because I'd been gearing up to, to do, to…

536
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:59.319
Shawn Murphy: start capturing the real-time sort of video aspect of our inter… of interactions, for a long time, but then finally managed to start implementing some, hyper… so-called hype… I'm calling it hyper-video, is the way I refer to that.

537
01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.980
Shawn Murphy: that…

538
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:17.179
Shawn Murphy: capability suite that, that Jose was identifying. In effect, capturing our interactions all the way from the real time, down through the, the extractions of, of

539
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:22.689
Shawn Murphy: of the verbiage, down through, and I think maybe, maybe…

540
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:30.539
Shawn Murphy: I'm going a little farther than is typical here, down to the conceptual

541
01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:40.600
Shawn Murphy: as a semantic extraction. So, in other words, into a machine-understandable representation that's ontology-based.

542
01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:51.319
Shawn Murphy: Okay? So, that's the span, as far as I'm concerned, is, is all the way from, real-time interaction capture,

543
01:18:51.450 --> 01:19:07.879
Shawn Murphy: down through the full… down through the explicit conceptual that is graphable, extractable, navigable, summarizable, etc, in a… in a deep machine-supported way. And so… so, yeah, I…

544
01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:23.639
Shawn Murphy: Jose, oh my god, let's make, let's make beautiful, nerd music together, because, we, we, we shouldn't be, we shouldn't be in separate, silos here if, if we're doing the same work.

545
01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:38.829
Shawn Murphy: Let's figure out how to, how to make some magic together. And, and I'd really love to take up, Scott's point about what is collaboration? Is it really what we think it is? We, we need to get so deep

546
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:48.510
Shawn Murphy: So much deeper about, about, the micro… microcognitive interactions

547
01:19:48.630 --> 01:20:02.090
Shawn Murphy: that… that constitute, the integration of our mental models. Because really, that's what… that's what this is all about. It is about how our…

548
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:10.265
Shawn Murphy: How our individual understandings are informed by Bye.

549
01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:20.540
Shawn Murphy: By our onboarding of, of others' insights, and, and how we can manage to,

550
01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:37.199
Shawn Murphy: in the limit and in the large, aggregate those understandings as a superposition across all minds of, into what I would refer to as the merged mental model.

551
01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:52.040
Shawn Murphy: And so that… that's… that's the work that I'm deeply trying to do, is, is make that repository so that… so that we're… we're migrating from, ultimately, from natural language

552
01:20:52.190 --> 01:21:03.239
Shawn Murphy: As this, loose and floppy, interaction modality, into a, in effect, a shared address space

553
01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.070
Shawn Murphy: interaction.

554
01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:08.839
Shawn Murphy: on the merged mental model, and I know that's just…

555
01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:13.190
Shawn Murphy: Sounds ludicrously abstract, but… but that… that's… that's…

556
01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:22.850
Shawn Murphy: That's what humanity is straining for, even if it doesn't know that. Okay. Over.

557
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:30.049
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, Sean, thank you. And I think you and Jose both know that Marc-Antoine Perrin is a fellow traveler on your journeys.

558
01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:34.970
Jerry Michalski: And I'm now going to reflect and say that it feels to me like the three of you

559
01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:44.960
Jerry Michalski: This is gonna sound worse than I mean it. The three of you have been working very hard for a very long time to manually do what training in LLM actually does now.

560
01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:47.990
Shawn Murphy: Yesterday.

561
01:21:47.990 --> 01:22:02.780
Jerry Michalski: Yes and no. Yes and no. The unknowable token vector space that's inside of an LLM and gives us back this weird magic of, oh my god, whole thoughts and is doing a lot of what the three of you have been researching and figuring out.

562
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:15.530
Shawn Murphy: Mark Antoine and Jack Park and I are working very, very closely together, trying to go super deep and, and establish a, a ground

563
01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:40.510
Shawn Murphy: for that kind of intercognitive, exchange that, that is deep and solid, like a… a… a granite upon which, such, such modeling can occur. But, but for clarity, I would distinguish, Jerry, between, between LLM, and LCM, where LCM is,

564
01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:44.820
Shawn Murphy: is the, is terminology that, I…

565
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:49.510
Shawn Murphy: I'm hearing come out of Meta,

566
01:22:49.530 --> 01:23:03.430
Shawn Murphy: And what they're… one of the things they're trying to do is, is move to a cons… a modeling, a large modeling, foundation, as opposed to a large language foundation.

567
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:12.170
Shawn Murphy: because of the… of the ambiguities and the… and the kind of the rough statistical quality of LLM approaches.

568
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:30.409
Shawn Murphy: Where instead, I would suggest that that's not really… that language is the interchange modality, but concepts are what we really want to interconnect. And so we need to be so strict with ourselves about distinguishing between those different modalities.

569
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:43.469
Jerry Michalski: And we have very little time left in this call, and I love… I love this particular thread, but I'm unclear on that, and would like to learn more, so, let's bounce to… we've got Gil Scott Rick, and maybe a poem.

570
01:23:44.030 --> 01:24:00.539
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, let me try to be compact. Sean, it doesn't sound ludicrous, but I've got other things to say about it, which I'll come back to in a minute. I want to stir 3 or 4 other pots that people have set boiling on the stove. Jerry, I'm intrigued by your problem with Improve.

571
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:15.650
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: as being maybe too directive, but I wonder how else a human being can orient in that. Like, better is the same thing as improve, and da-da-da-da. And it's all subjective, and, you know, there's always the possibility that one person's better is somebody else is worse, and so there you go.

572
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:19.959
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which, of course, brings us to the RFK Jr. thing, and the challenge of…

573
01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:38.200
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: of dancing with people where you agree on some things and disagree on some things, and we are in a moment in our culture where it seems to be all or nothing, black or white. If somebody's wrong on something, they're wrong on everything. But yesterday, we heard Marjorie Taylor Greene saying she's prepared to stand up in Congress and read the stuff that the Epstein victims have gathered.

574
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:40.429
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Into the public records, so, you know…

575
01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:46.849
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: The strange thing about united fronts is that you don't have to agree on everything.

576
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:49.090
Jerry Michalski: topsy-turvy world, is all I can tell.

577
01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:50.380
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Thanks, buddy.

578
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:56.260
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, and what's your name? Blanking my name,

579
01:24:57.070 --> 01:25:09.400
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Bernice Reagan, one of the founders of Sweet Honey and the Rock, was in the Freedom Singers in the early 1960s, and the Civil Rights Movement, notably said at a conference in California back 30-some-odd years ago, he said, if you're in a coalition.

580
01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.210
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And you're not deeply uncomfortable all the time.

581
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:15.310
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Your coalition's not big enough.

582
01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:21.689
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I think that's a challenge for us to consider now, because we're in a cultural moment that goes the other way.

583
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:29.450
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Scott, collaboration really resonated for me, the notion of collaboration as a skill to develop.

584
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:41.040
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and a culture to develop, and ways of speaking and listening and being that enable that is rich territory, and I hope we come back to that at some point.

585
01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.710
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And,

586
01:25:44.760 --> 01:26:01.060
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Sean and Joe say the hyper video, when I think about… I'm trying to write a book or two, and I keep on reminding myself, what if it's not a book? Book is, like, in quotes all the time, because that's one part of the artifact web that we're putting together here. I'm concerned, though.

587
01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.130
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: About the notion of…

588
01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:10.209
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: trying to get it all machine understandable, because I suspect there are things that the machines cannot and will never understand.

589
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.570
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I think that's very important territory.

590
01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:15.610
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I'm not…

591
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:25.720
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm not drawn to trying to cram that into machine understandable form. I'm trying… I'm concerned with finding ways that we can enrich that dimension of human

592
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:34.720
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: being in the world of AIs and emerging alien intelligence and so forth, and so that's a mystery for me that, that's really juicy.

593
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.870
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I suspect you guys are oriented to that. No, Jerry, who is the third fellow traveler you mentioned?

594
01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:42.620
Jerry Michalski: Marc Antoine Powell…

595
01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:51.610
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Okay, okay, great. Anyhow, I'm not prepared to dive into this project with you, but I'm very interested in staying aware of what you're up to.

596
01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.460
Jerry Michalski: Brilliant.

597
01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:54.619
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Thank you, Paul.

598
01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:55.819
Jerry Michalski: Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

599
01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.529
Jerry Michalski: Scott?

600
01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:00.629
Jerry Michalski: We are muted.

601
01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:16.920
Scott Moehring: Very quickly, I also agree with Gil that the nature of improve doesn't bother me much. I think if you're open to feedback, you do your best, and we're all searching for what better is.

602
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:28.869
Scott Moehring: So I'm good with that. Ken, I made a… had a realization years ago that after leaving school, the only clean break we get is taking a new job.

603
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:39.089
Scott Moehring: And I realized that I missed it. It was the semester break, it was the end, it was the new books, it was… you know what? However that went.

604
01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:47.730
Scott Moehring: it's done. And now I'm… And I missed it, because I was always working, and I never had that…

605
01:27:47.850 --> 01:27:53.629
Scott Moehring: that break, you know, when you work someplace for a decade, it's just the same. So, that's enough for me.

606
01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:05.789
Jerry Michalski: Scott, thank you. And, if I may say, I think your question about, is collaboration a thing, might be next Thursday's call topic. It sounds like a really nice thing to dive into, so…

607
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:17.359
Jerry Michalski: If you want to say… if you wouldn't mind sending me a message with a little bit, just a couple paragraphs on what you mean by your question, so that… so that I aim toward what you mean, not toward what I'm thinking you mean, that would be great.

608
01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:19.120
Jerry Michalski: Rick, please.

609
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:30.110
Rick Botelho: Yeah, I'm glad this scene of collaboration is ricocheting, because I think it's one of those things that… it's quite complex, and we need to be much better at it.

610
01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:45.090
Rick Botelho: And to highlight a point that Gil was talking about, having a coalition big enough so you can have more healthy disagreements, because that's where the greatest learning happens. I'll put in a point of view of difference here, which we won't have time to discuss.

611
01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:53.900
Rick Botelho: But, when I heard Jose talking about, content curation, I'm actually more interested in process curation.

612
01:28:54.310 --> 01:29:07.130
Rick Botelho: And for that reason, I'm not interested in neobooks. I'm interested in neo-learning, which is more dynamic from my perspective, learning, and thinking about how we can use platforms for that, so it's much more agile.

613
01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:21.020
Rick Botelho: Everything you said, I agree with, the elements of it, but take it to the process level, because if we can't get our process sorted out, we can't do our collaboration. All the content and collaborations is useless unless we know how to do the process.

614
01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:40.549
Rick Botelho: So, just to demonstrate that I do listen to people about their criticisms about my compound philosophical questions, I put a link in there for people who are curious to understand compound philosophical questions, and the reasons why we have to shift to slow thinking to deal with complexity.

615
01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:56.469
Rick Botelho: And lastly, I go to a group which some of you may know about. It's called CHAO out of Belgium, which is a change management, change agent group, and their focus is on collaboration. I'll put the link in there. Their meeting is on, Friday mornings at,

616
01:29:56.770 --> 01:30:13.790
Rick Botelho: I think it's 9… 8.45, Eastern Time. I'll put the link in there as well, if people would like to learn from a European perspective about their thinking about, collaboration, and that's what they're… it's an interesting group, anyway, I'll put that link in as well.

617
01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:18.110
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Rick. Stacy, you're going to have the penultimate word.

618
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:41.329
Stacey Druss: Yeah, real quick, because I was triggered by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who I obviously would not want to be as a, you know, sit down to dinner with her or be near her. That being said, I want to just highlight the importance. She really is a true believer, and I just want to highlight how important it is to deal with people that are true to their beliefs, whether or not we like them or not.

619
01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.999
Stacey Druss: To know that

620
01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:52.969
Stacey Druss: say is what they're going to stand by, which is not what we have with most of the politicians. So I just want to, once again, reiterate that, even in dealing with

621
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:55.310
Stacey Druss: Who we deal with in our lives.

622
01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:56.390
Stacey Druss: Over.

623
01:30:57.230 --> 01:30:59.039
Jerry Michalski: Thank you very much, and, and…

624
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:05.650
Jerry Michalski: There's something about people being really authentic and true to their core, even if we hate what they're saying, that's important, and…

625
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:09.899
Jerry Michalski: we shouldn't just ignore or wander away from. So, thank you.

626
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:11.979
Jerry Michalski: Sir Ken.

627
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:25.880
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: This poem is called Game by Maxine Koeman. Before he died, Archduke Ferdinand… Archduke Franz Ferdinand, gunned down in Sarajevo to jumpstart World War I,

628
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:35.580
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Bragged that he had shot 3,000 stags and a miscellaneous foxes, geese, wolves, and boars, driven toward him by beaters.

629
01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:41.619
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Stout men he ordered to flush the creatures from their cover into his sights, a tradition.

630
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:45.050
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: of the British aristocracy. Carried on.

631
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:48.849
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Further aped by rich Americans, from Teddy R. to Ernest H,

632
01:31:48.850 --> 01:32:05.269
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Something Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Padgison of a Sicilian immigrant, indulged in years later when he had scores of farm-raised birds beaten from their cages and scared up for him to shoot down, which brought him an inner joy.

633
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:08.819
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: What happened to him when he was a boy?

634
01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.520
Mike Nelson: Goddamn. Wow.

635
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:26.380
Jerry Michalski: Well, Ken, please, again? That's, like, wow. That's just like a layup poem, somehow. It's, like, completely non-obvious, but it's like, OMG, they went right to the heart of something important, so… wow.

636
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:30.619
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Game, Maxine Koeman.

637
01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:48.529
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Before he died, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, gunned down in Sarajevo to jumpstart World War I, bragged that he had shot 3,000 stags and a miscellany of foxes, geese, wolves, and boars, driven toward him by beaters.

638
01:32:48.540 --> 01:33:05.950
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Stout men he ordered to flush creatures from their cover into his sights, a tradition of the British aristocracy, carried on, further aped by rich Americans from Teddy R. to Ernest H, something Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.

639
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:19.920
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: pudgy son of Sicilian immigrants indulged in years later, when he had scores of farm-raised birds beaten from their cages and scared up for him to shoot down, which brought him an inner joy.

640
01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.329
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: What happened to him when he was a boy?

641
01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.660
Jerry Michalski: Just awesome.

642
01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:31.799
Mike Nelson: Thank you.

643
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.790

645
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:36.000

646
01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:40.500
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Maxine… Kuman, K-U-M-I-N.

647
01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.529
Jerry Michalski: K-U-M-I-N, Maxine Kuhman.

648
01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:55.169
Jerry Michalski: And he will, as usual, post the poem to the OGM list so you can have it later. I think we have a nice topic for next Thursday, and thank you for all showing up so beautifully.

649
01:33:56.030 --> 01:34:02.759
Jerry Michalski: The ladies of OGM were underrepresented today, which makes me sad, but, so it was.

650
01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.019
Jerry Michalski: There we are.

651
01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.979
