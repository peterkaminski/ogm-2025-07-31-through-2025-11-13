WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
that does the opposite of what they were trying to do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yeah, and the Cherokee often want a truck doll to run their business, because the chalk dollar.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's hilarious.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's like having a Shabbos goi turned on and off, turn your switches on and off on Shabbat.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Much more transactional commercial folks. Uh, this…

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Very cool.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Something like that. It's… yeah, they, they… They don't think transactionally well. The Choctaw have always done that, and I could go further into the Choctaw, but yeah.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Thank you so much for that story. Gil, please.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's a wonderful story, Kevin, thank you. And the what does this decision make us is a question that's going to be resonating with me for a while, so thank you for that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Um, it's a great example of how

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
how contextual this whole conversation is, because, you know, I would… I might assume something about Native American culture, but no, Cherokee different than Choctaw.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
No, actually, within Cherokee, differences within, you know,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So, all of that situational.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah, and Cherokee Nation is much more transactional than Eastern Band and Katua.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yeah, and you say, but even within Cherokee Nation, there's going to be differences in the different formations that people have, and I'm struck that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If I were in conversation with that tribe, talking, you know, if I were you in that situation,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and asked…

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Um, hey guys, what's going on? Haven't heard from you for a while, being curious about the process of the transaction. That would have been very unwelcome.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And not helpful.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Whereas in another setting, I'm at a SOCAP conference, you might ask that question to somebody.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the fastest way to go slower with the tribe is to probe.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Great.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Mm-hmm. Probe how, what does that mean?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
is to probe, you know, to say, hey, what's up?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You know, it's like, they've said they're going off to think about it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Oh, okay, so you're saying, yeah, that will slow things down. I gotcha.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Right, like, you don't get welcome to the camp if you come into the camp.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Get visible. And then you wait, and you get invited when it's time to invite you. I mean, it's that kind of.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You know, drives me fucking crazy, but, you know, it's what you have to do.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Yeah. I had a friend years ago who, um, lived in…

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I guess northwestern Maryland.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
very rural northwestern Maryland.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And their family had been there for 20 years before they had a conversation with somebody, not on their front porch, but in their house.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Hmm.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
20 years before they were invited in from the porch into the house.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Completely friendly, you know, friendly conversations on the porch, but that's where it was.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Until… something opened.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's a whole new perspective on slow to warm up.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Um…

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There we go. Mhm.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Yeah, thanks. Our senses of what is… our intimacy gradient is a way of expressing this, like, who would you invite into your bedroom, to your living room, onto your porch?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to your block party, that there's a series of concentric rings,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And each culture, and then within each person probably has different settings.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Great.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
for, like, who gets to be where, and how… and what you…

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
what the framing is for that particular ring. Like, oh, in this ring, it's okay to talk about

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This kind of stuff, but not okay, you know, further out. All those kinds of things. And then there are people who just, like,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Live their lives fully in public and have no rings, apparently.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Uh, Alex.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Hmm.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Thank you, very, very interesting. I wanted to… I was very, sort of, I resonated with a lot of what Louise said, not about the teaching side.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But about what things are, like… No insult intended.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that chances are, if I see you in another Zoom group.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I will not recognize any of you. Literally, your different entities, and in my mind.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000
it's a different set. I cannot recognize people. Uh, it's always a joke when going to the station, I go past neighbors and friends or whatever.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Because, like, they're out of context to where they're supposed to be. So… so the reason… so it's a different mentality brain.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But what, on the other side is, and a number of you have said it, is.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I don't know how many of you have this feeling.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I will not use anything or do anything, or travel in anything where I don't.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
understand how it works. I know how cars work.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I know how jets work. I have looked through the manual of a 747 jet engine when I was 15.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Because I feel the need to know. I wouldn't get on a plane without knowing this. I wonder how many other people feel like that, because.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And that is the inner curiosity that some people have.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And, uh, maybe I'm… Like some people said, I've talked to everyone. I talk to everyone so much.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I have no… no barrier. I will ask them anything, and some people, especially in Britain, the British people, a lot of them are very reserved.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And, you know, not difficult to cross the barrier. You can ask about the weather, you can ask about.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
anything not important. But as soon as you ask anything remotely personal, it's just like.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
goes out of the window, and I kind of upset a lot of people, strangers, so that's okay.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Um, one of the things I found interesting in talking to young people.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And… but it's not just, you know, just happen to be young people in one company I was working in. When we're doing Brexit in Britain.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
it was a big thing. Everybody was talking about it, took years to resolve.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And I was sitting at lunch with some young people, they're all like 22, 23, 24.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I started talking about Brexit, you know, political, you know, being mean, sensitive, you know, go and.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And, to my surprise, they all turned round, the three of them, and said, we don't watch the news.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I said, but it's a big thing, don't you care?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
No, so did you vote? No. We just don't care.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You know, so, like, they didn't say don't care.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
we're just not interested. And that really profoundly shocked me, that there are people in this world.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that are like that, so incurious. Um, on the one point about Louise and the AIs, what I want to say was I'm one of those people.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Because of the faces and everything else, I never understand. You can tell me something.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
you know, the teacher would tell me something, I could never understand it because my comprehension's not quite right, etc.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And, um, I was too embarrassed to ask clarifying questions, because eventually it got really annoying.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
To the teacher. She'd answer the same question 3 times at different angles, and I still didn't get it.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But do you know what? Since ChatGPT came along?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Oh, fantastic. I asked the same question in different ways, and eventually I understand it.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And that is brilliant. And I wonder whether kids may actually benefit from that.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So, because you don't… you don't feel like being… you're not going to be dumb asking the same question to an AI 50 different times.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Um, but I just thought… I wonder whether that would improve things if you… if you have the teacher.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and the AI to support. the teaching. And… That's it, thank you.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Thanks, Alex, very much. You reminded me of a little historical nugget. A friend of Kevin and mine, Joe Gouldy, who's a digital historian, wrote a book called Roads to Power.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Which was about the first turnpikes in England.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And before they started putting in turnpikes in England, nobody knew the whole country. There was no map of the whole country.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You only knew the road to the next town.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And when you start getting roads, you start getting carriage rides, and when you have carriage rides is the first time you have strangers contained in a small space.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So you have to invent things like, oh, lovely weather outside.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
That small talk is invented

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Apparently, in that culture,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
for the close confines of long travel in a carriage.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And it pervades cultures in all sorts of different ways, and probably showed up in other ways in other places, but it's cool.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Klaus, please.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Yeah, we have been… Or fueling individual curiosity, but there's also.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000
A commons persona, you know, as people, so Brexit is a great example. How was Brexit possible?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It's because there was… Uh, uh… a curiosity of the comments about what does this all imply and what does it mean.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And where should we be drifting, and where should we be going?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So the… looking at this not just from an individual perspective, but from a commons perspective, you know, from… from… Where the majority is moving, moving around, and maybe having groups within.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the Commons, who have divergent opinions. I mean, that's also… I mean, it's heavily cultural, but it's also… Um, uh, a way to define curiosity.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You know, to… because the… the… And I'm not quite sure how to really frame this, but… Um, the… the common mind is curious about and interested in information, and of course it's being manipulated and.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And messed around with. And the reason why I'm so, so maybe more aware of it is because.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Now I've been working on climate change, I've been working on.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Uh, getting people to understand food within the context of climate and environment.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And there is a shift in public perception. You know, you can see that opinion bending towards.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
an understanding of health and of nutrition, and so on.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And the impact on environment. Um, but it's… it's, um… and I think the curiosity is there.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But you're fighting these, these… information streams that are contradicting each other, you know, and that are manipulated.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So how does that all play a role here? How does that… you know, enter the idea of what is curiosity. You know, if you can't distinguish between.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
what's right and wrong, and not wanting to be misled, you know, having to have the trust.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
To… to… towards an information source. And then… and then, uh, commit yourself to that information source versus.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
you know, dismissing, you know, others. So I think there's a… there are a lot of nuances here that.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
That are a little bit more difficult to define.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Absolutely, Klaus. You just opened up in my brain

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000
sort of the QAnon and other conspiracy theorist comment of, I did… well, I did the research, or do your own research.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And people going off onto the intratubes.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And discovering God knows what. And this is sort of at that boundary between curiosity and critical thinking, but also misinformation, disinformation, etc., etc.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And strangely enough, collective sense-making, which is an incredibly OGM-y topic.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
part of the reason we're here is how do we… how do we make sense of our world together?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Um, Scott, please.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
As I am… want to do, I…

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
have an idea about…

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
a way to define curiosity, or one definition.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Hmm.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And Scott, your volume seems to be really low. If you can lean toward your mic or turn up the gain or something, but keep going.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Alright, um, well, we'll just talk a little louder for a minute.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Um…

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Curiosity. Noticing things you don't…

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
didn't have to notice.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I'm gonna put that in the chat. I just want to see…

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
If that resonates with anyone.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I've been thinking about noticing, and that seems to fit.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
What?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Well, curiosity. Noticing things you didn't have to notice.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Thank you. Pete, please.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I wanted to echo Alex's…

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
discussion of not going in things that you don't know how they work. Um, I'm not quite that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
that extreme, but I certainly…

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
in a building, or in a city, or in a vehicle, or whatever, wherever I'm at,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I usually know a lot about the infrastructure of it, and…

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And I feel a lot better about it because of that. Um…

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And it's… it's just a way I live. It's not…

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
you know, it's… I don't feel like I'm super curious about things, or that I've got to find out stuff.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Although, demonstrably, kind of, I am compared to other people. Um…

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Uh… and…

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I… I, uh, I'm gonna put a link to a Washington Post article, um, and I'm not gonna archive

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
ph at, um, you'll have to do that yourself, but it's…

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Washington Post found 47,000 conversations with ChatGPT that kind of spilled out onto the internet, and they've… they've collected them up and kind of went through them, so…

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
What do people talk with ChatGPT about?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And some of the… some of the things were just, like, heart-stoppingly… heartbreaking.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
for me to read, because…

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
When I'm using a chat system, a ChatGPT or Cloud or whatever, I know how it works, I know

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
why it does what it does, how, you know, I can predict, you know, not entirely accurately, but I can kind of predict.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
It's gonna be good at these things, it's gonna be bad at these things, it's going to pretend to be good at these things, and it's going to be wrong.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And that doesn't freak me out, you know? It's like writing in a… in a…

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
a jet airplane, and knowing

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.000
What kinds of things would break and are no big deal, and what kinds of things might seem like not a big deal, but they're huge, and, like, every… it's a disaster, right?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I know that kind of thing about jet airplanes, or cars, or buses, or, you know, uh…

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
tall buildings, or whatever.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Um, and so it…

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
it… kind of terrifies me, thinking that people are using these…

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
things that are able to ape human emotions effectively.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Um, with… with absolutely no intent or… or care about what they're doing, because they cannot have care, not because they don't, you know, they don't…

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
give a hoot. They can't.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Um, but they pretend that they do, or they act like they do, in a way that confuses people, and…

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
There's a bunch of people who don't know how, you know, AI works, and they get fooled by it, and they…

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
They do all kinds of crazy things with it.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
This… it reminds me also, in a strange way, this… I'm going to say something that I feel like

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
is embarrassing to say in public. Um…

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Uh, I am pretty successful at using

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Don't do this at home, folks. I'm pretty successful at using ChatGPT as health advice. And I was thinking about that. I had a… I had a kind of a health scare. It ended up in the hospital for a few days. I spent a lot of time with ChatGPT.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Uh, asking stupid questions of it, rather than a nurse, because nurses are busy doing other

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000
more important things, apparently. Um, uh, no offense to nurses or even the medical system, but ChatGPT was a huge help to me, and I'm like,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Okay, how can I tell people that I did this?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And I did it in a safe way.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Because, just like jet airplanes and, you know, excavators and tall buildings, I know a lot about health systems, too. Health systems and my health, and…

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
how… how medicine works, and I can understand an explanation from ChatGPT and ask

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
penetrating questions about, are you… are you sure that you thought about this or that, you know, in a way that I feel…

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
safe to navigate with ChatGPT,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
giving me health advice. I wouldn't recommend that to most people, and again, don't do it at home.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Um, but, uh, it's, uh, it was shocking meeting the Washington Post thing, going, oh my god, people are using these technologies and have no clue how it works, and they're getting tricked by it. Um, not because the thing is trying to trick it,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Because they've… they're in a context where they don't have enough information about it.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Thanks.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Thanks, Pete. Louise?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Well, that's an interesting one for me to lead on to, because I do reflect on the use of AI.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Um, in an education environment. I can see there would be so many benefits. I mean, I'm fortunate to have small classes of, say, 24 students.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
But you can imagine trying to give those 24 students individual focused attention is very challenging.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But if they have an AI bot that can respond to them.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Which can lead them, which can assess them, and move them on.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We have individual students moving at an individual pace.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And I can see a huge benefit in that, but you've, um, it's Pete.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:54.000
has given me then a lot of that concern, you know, we've got to have some confidence that that, um, AI is capable of doing that, maybe in a focused, um.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000
on a focused topic or subject, you can have an AI that could lead students through a learning experience and let them.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Um, at their own pace, but also at their own level of curiosity, um, explore a subject.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Um, something the conversation has really highlighted for me, which is going to be beneficial when I'm teaching, is that this curiosity is so multifaceted.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
that I may not recognize curiosity from a student about this particular maths lesson.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
But they probably do have the curiosity in some area that's engrossing for them.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Um, and I may just not be aware of that. I mustn't judge them just in their… in the environment of curiosity in my classroom.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and maths, so that's been very helpful, um, today.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Um, one thing I might mention is if you are interested in Brexit, I don't know if you've seen the film, which I found very, um, enlightening, although I do appreciate.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
It's sort of a docudrama, where, um, Benedict Cumberbutch plays Dominic Cummings.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And, um, it explores the ways that, um. They managed to influence and convince the public that 2X it was the vote.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So that's quite interesting to watch.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Thank you so much, Luis. Excuse me.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Oops, uh, John.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Okay, so…

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
one of the ideas about Curiosity was,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Noticing things that you don't absolutely have to notice.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You may notice that I'm in a different context than I was earlier in the call.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And, um, if you're curious…

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I'm actually in a hyperbaric chamber, and we're just under 2 atmospheres

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And about 46% oxygen.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Which is, um…

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
as nominally therapeutic benefits for both

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Certainly conditions, certain disease conditions, but also…

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
you know, as both a longevity or a cognitive enhancement, um…

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
tools, and that's how I'm using it.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Um, and also to build on the comments about teaching,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I taught different levels, you know.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
young kids, high school, college, and adults.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And, uh…

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
There are techniques which…

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
If you thought this was curiosity, you would be…

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
oversimplifying, on the one hand. On the other hand,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
they're quite powerful, particularly if

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
You can, um…

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
alter the social meaning of it. So, a classic one that

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000
all of us who have done any consulting, or even just people who are here. I mean, you've heard of the five whys things, where you just keep asking why.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
water. And you basically take apart

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
each answer…

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
You don't accept it as, you know, that's not the… that's not the ultimate why, the other whys are underneath.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
That's just an example of one kind of question. I actually

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
noticed in teaching that

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
It's possible to over-focus on why.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
when you haven't done the previous work about what

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And how? And how is a more neutral version of why?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Y assumes, you know, why… we tend to look for motivation. We tend to look for a human actor and a motivation.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And it's a good place to look, you know, if you're…

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
If you're in a mystery story, or if you're in a…

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
you know, stupid.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Murder mystery or other kind of mysteries, but…

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
There's other kinds of… kinds of collaborative coherence of, uh…

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000
causes, and you might not notice those unless you said how instead of why. And also, if you said what?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
First. And…

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
What about the fact that students, and I had… I had plenty of

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
militantly uncurious students.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
first-gener… first generation college.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
in a mill town,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Hmm.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
you know, their ideal… their career goal was to become a shop teacher.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
you know, they were… they were there…

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
When I started talking about communication, they said, well,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
When are we going to laminate?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And they had pictures of motorcycles and things like this that they wanted to land. This is college. This is college.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
But it was… it was a shock to me, but I found that if you created a context in which

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
There's a social reason

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
for participating and pursuing a question like the five whys. They'll participate for the social reason,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And then down the road, they'll get the benefit in terms of

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
the enrichment of the conversation and the possibility of

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
say, oh, we actually, uh…

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
discovered something that we weren't looking for, and we weren't particularly… if you'd told us

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
But look for it, we would not have necessarily done it, but we did it in the context of…

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
playing this little game, and as a result of playing the little game,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
We now have a different perspective.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
So… that's it.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Thank you, John.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Kevin?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Yeah, you know, this is going from, don't try this at home.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
And sort of part of my approach to life or something.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
About 25 years ago, I was in Rajasthan in a mogul fort.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And there was a Fakir who does, uh, you know, a random pattern to keep a cobra.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Um… from going at it. And I've been told just a few weeks before by a woman that I was hard to follow in dance, so I wanted to see how it would be with the cobra.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
So I bought a… Little pipe thing, little tube, whatever those things are.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And, uh, got a little closer, and so the cobra focused on me, and it turned… I did my little funky thing, and within.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Less than 30 seconds, the Cobra had me figured out better than Sean McConnell's wife had.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:14.000
But I plan my exit well. I knew what to do with my right hand and with my left leg, and just spin behind, and so that he was in the line of fire, and my kids are watching me, and it's like.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I didn't have to tell them, don't try this, because they'd seen me, you know, do something, um.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
But it was a great time… the moment of being eye-to-eye with a cobra.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
It's something I would do… And I don't regret doing.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
But I'm glad they didn't think they needed to do it, so I'm really glad that my kids have not seen me as a role model.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
This is a good, non-replicable parenting moment.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Thanks, Kevin.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Stacy. Stacy, you're ending up in the queue after people saying incredible things, so…

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Good luck. Go ahead.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Thank you. Yeah, I just… I just wanted to say that.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Um, I think we're… there's a little bit of a blurry line.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000
between the noticing and the curious, and I just want to remind everybody, we are all curious.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So, just saying that. With the noticing, I do believe there are people that.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.000
They just don't notice. And, like, they may not have the ability to notice, and so if you don't notice in the first place, you can't be curious.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Then there are people that notice. And they're not curious, and there's a difference there. So I just wanted to point that out.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Thanks, Stacey. And, and, and…

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
So much of all of this is about how we direct our attention, or how we mind our attention, or what we pay attention to.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
However you want to phrase that.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
And because only that will direct us to be curious and give us the avenue, as you just described.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000
We were very close to the end of our time together today, so I'm wondering if anybody has

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Victoria, did we miss things? Would you rather us have a more solid framework? I haven't been able to track the Excalibra.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
board very well, but I've…

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Well, the scale draw has been growing.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And it can be opened

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
longer, so anybody who wants to continue the conversation there, that would be great.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
It's always great to have the conversation going on.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
I will say that…

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Um, I ask here in the chat if anyone knew about the question.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
formulation technique.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
That is, uh, methodology that the right question institute launched some years ago.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
I think we need to do something like that.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
with a good focus question,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And start asking the questions first.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
And then, like, playing with…

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
These questions…

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Prioritize, and then decide what to do.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Because I love the conversation, I've learned a lot.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
But I don't think we have really…

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
start to uncover half of…

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
what Curiosity is about.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Because we were explaining our hypothesis instead of asking questions.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Hmm, okay. Um, so the four rules for producing questions from…

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
the question formulation technique, I'll just read them into the room so that we're aware, because I think you're suggesting we use this?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Um, yeah, so the four…

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
So, if you are, uh, if you want some combat, some…

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
of the meeting could go like this, so just to practice.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Um, so the four rules for producing questions are

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Ask as many questions as you can.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Write down every question exactly as stated,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
And then change any statements into questions.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
That's the process. Um, and it would be fun to experiment with that.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Victoria, have you… have you run any meetings or sessions where you've used this?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Uh, I was attending a seminar.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
more or less, very informal, just like this.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Among people who were interested in learning about Greek mythology.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And the idea was that we raised the theme, and one person was preparing the theme for the next session.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And people would come with questions.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Nobody did, nobody asked, of course.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Until I suggested this,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And then…

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
We had so many questions, and we were able, like, to really

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
go in the direction we want it, because

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000
We ended with those lids of, uh, questions, prioritize them, decide what to do with them,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Uh, some people were, like,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
For example, I want to invest to go further, uh, research,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
The…

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
The hero hearing…

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
uh… difference…

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I want to go through this other path, so…

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
It's one decided

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
The next session, instead of having this, like,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
standardized sessions.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Because they were the topics everybody talks about?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
And it was really enriched in.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
enricher for everybody.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
So, maybe we can…

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Use it at least once.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
to uncover anything we can,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
About curiosity, or about anything else that's not the…

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
The issue is not the theme, it's that we practice with this.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
That maybe can bring something new to this…

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Conversations.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Um, I like it. Uh, and I'm…

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
tempted to…

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
go back to the topic of curiosity, or just shift around? I don't know…

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
open to whatever anybody wants to suggest, but I think using this would be great.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
I think my… the immediate question that comes to mind is,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
At the end of this process, you have apparently a really long, great list of questions, then what do you do?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Now, the next steps, the question formulation technique does not end in the list of questions.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Right? Okay.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
It ends when you decide to prioritize the questions,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
And what to do with the first three questions that are in your list?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Awesome. Thank you.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Um, beautiful.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:00.000
So I… let's you and I talk about that some more, so we can sort of set this up. Anybody else who's interested, let us know on the OGM list.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And, um…

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
We don't have Ken for a while, he's stepped away from conversations like this for a bit, so we don't have a poem.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
from him at the end of the call, which is…

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Sad for me. But, uh…

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
We'll be back in a week. So, thank you very much for a great call. That was… this was… this was…

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
a terrific exploration, really appreciate it.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Thank you all.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Wonderful, thank you.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Gabriele, welcome, thanks, nice to see you.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
And Louise as well.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Thanks, thanks, thank you. Yeah, yeah, thank you, Jerry.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I had some good insights from that. Yeah, I'm really intrigued about this, um… Uh, asking questions, things.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:59.000
So I'm going to breathe on something online. Or… how can I, um… Uh, you said that if… If I am interested, how can I… manifest those interest if you're going to do something about this.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
The question formulating or, uh… Uh, in the future.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
So you… yeah, you are not yet on the OGM Google group, the mailing list that we use, so Victoria gave…

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Victoria gave me your email address. Is it okay if I add you to this… to the list?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
No, I…

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Sounds great. And then, so on that list is where we talk

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
That's… that's our conversational space, so…

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Uh, that would be the place.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Yes.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Nice. Perfect.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Jerry? Jerry? Can you… can you put… can you put Victoria's, um, thing on the email?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
the, um… I don't know what it's called, the Caledra of whatever.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
I will add a link to the Excaladraw map

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Bored.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
to the email that I post when I posted this session online. That's a…

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Great idea. Will do, Stacy, thank you.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Bye, everybody.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:54.000
And Gabrielle, if you do… if you do write and post something, uh, post it also to the OGM mailing list so we can see it.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
I'm sorry, I don't…

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.000
I think you said you were going to write or post something about your exploration. I invite you to share it with us on the OGM mailing list.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
once I put you on the list.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Cool. Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Okay. Thank you.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Thanks, everybody. Bye, all.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Appreciate it.
