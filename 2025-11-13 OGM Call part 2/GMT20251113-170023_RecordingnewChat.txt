00:13:16	Eve Blossom:	This conversation is so lovely. I need to run to another meeting but wanted to add here about somatic. Somatic experiencing can deepen curiosity by helping the body feel safe to explore rather than be passive, be reactive, turning tension and overwhelm into spaciousness for new perceptions. When we tune into the subtle signals of the body, curiosity becomes less an effort of the mind and more a natural opening to what is present, possible, and previously unseen.

00:16:02	Scott Moehring:	Trying this out….  “Curiosity = Noticing things you didn’t have to notice.”  Does that resonate?
00:16:27	Kevin Jones:	It does not. I am curious about things i need to know first
00:17:13	Kevin Jones:	@Judith Benham seeing your thumb a lot
00:18:12	Scott Moehring:	@Kevin  If you need to know them, isn’t the motivation then different from curiosity?
00:18:41	Kevin Jones:	I do not think so.

To me, curiosity extends beyond "noticing" and gets into "exploring"

@John Warinner @Pete Kaminski  Interesting! I like the exploration addition. The exploratory circuits are essential to learning the things we need to know. 

I’m thinking about the feeling of asking  “Why aren’t you curious about that?”.
00:30:05	Gabriele G:	Replying to "Do any of you know a..."

This is so interesting! Thank you fort this share! I came in this conversation because I am attending an online workshop on Visual thinking (where I met Victoria) and we had a 1h q&a session with the teacher and I felt mixed: I was eager to know something new (since we can ask him anything) but on the other hand I was tense because "I don't know wha to ask (first)", I have some trails but they were so vague. So I apreciate there is a tool to delve deeper to learn how to come around with question "good" to ask.This open for me the point: why that anxiety/poverty to ask question when you have complete freedom?
00:31:24	Scott Moehring:	@Stacey Druss  Thanks for noticing this relationship —> Which comes first? Curious leading to noticing, or noticing leading to curiosity? That’s something I will be pondering.

00:32:22	Pete Kaminski:	from John K.: I found that if you created a context in which there's a social reason for participating and pursuing a question like the five whys, they'll participate for the social reason, and then down the road, they'll get the the benefit in terms of the enrichment of the conversation and the possibility of (paraphrased after this point) realizing, “Oh—we actually discovered something we weren’t even looking for.” If you’d told them to look for it, they probably wouldn’t have. But because it happened inside this little game, they ended up uncovering something new and walked away with a different perspective.

I’m energized when someone says “I’ve never thought of that this way before.” In fact it’s been a central metric in my work for decades. But that drives some people crazy! ;-)
