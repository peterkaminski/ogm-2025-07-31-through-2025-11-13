1
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:12.249
Jerry Michalski: Greetings. This is the open global mind community call for Thursday, July 31, st 2025. Last day of July.

2
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.868
Jerry Michalski: Tomorrow starts. August happened awful fast.

3
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Jerry Michalski: And next week's call will be a check in call. Next week's call. I will be away, so I'm I think I'm looking for I can open the room. But I'm I'm gonna be on vacation. So I'm gonna look for a volunteer who'd like to host

4
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.320
Jerry Michalski: next Thursday's Ogm call.

5
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.369
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Where are you going.

6
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.080
Jerry Michalski: Italy, going to the town of Bergamo, Italy.

7
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:59.720
Jerry Michalski: which is a walled city, an ancient city, and was the westernmost outpost of the Venetian Doge back in the day. So if you go to Milan and then drive 45 min northeast, you're in Bergamo. But Milan was the enemy, because the Milanese were the next Empire over.

8
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:29.750
Jerry Michalski: And so, Bergam, there's an old city that's up high. That's a little bit of an angle like this. It's like a lozenge plateau at a little angle, and then there's a new city down below, which is really very nice, and they made it a heritage site some years ago, and as a result there is not a stone place like the masonry is incredible, and what I've learned is that in Florence and Venice, when they started building all the fancy buildings. They would get their masons from Bergam because the masons were so famous.

9
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.500
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Oh!

10
00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:37.770
Jerry Michalski: So a lot of a lot of Florentine and Venetian architecture, and all that owes some some little debt to Berga Musk

11
00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:44.790
Jerry Michalski: people who knows, so I'll be there for 10 days, and then I'll come back and

12
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.409
Jerry Michalski: cool we are.

13
00:01:47.910 --> 00:02:06.050
Jerry Michalski: I thought. Last week's call on grief was a really lovely call. We tended to focus a lot on personal experiences of grief and handling things there. And I think when I was setting up that call the 1st time I thought there was a lot to talk about about societal grief, about about large scale grief.

14
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.869
Jerry Michalski: and how we process it well or poorly.

15
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:33.760
Jerry Michalski: And so I'm hoping to take us into that conversation today and see where that takes us. There's and we we also crossed into trauma a bit in the last call. And I think there's there's sort of a couple of concepts of intergenerational trauma societal trauma things like that. These are. These are, I think related. Subjects. Of course.

16
00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:46.820
Jerry Michalski: And Klaus, if if you don't mind, I think one of the I think one of the maybe obvious places to start. Here is German war, guilt and grief.

17
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.950
Jerry Michalski: and the processing, the generational processing of those kinds of things.

18
00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.959
Jerry Michalski: and whether or not that worked well, because what we see now is the rise of the far right in Germany, and a whole bunch of strange things happening that

19
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.090
Jerry Michalski: that

20
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:22.269
Jerry Michalski: I think the processing post-war was meant to avoid, or in some way, you know. Let's see if we can just skip creating another World war or participating in another World War. The formation of the EU was an attempt to diffuse the tensions between the countries in Europe and so forth. But

21
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.969
Jerry Michalski: do you mind just telling us what your your own experience of that has been.

22
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.150
Klaus Mager: Well, Germany went through an incredible

23
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:39.889
Klaus Mager: time. I was born in 1949, you know, and and then I was

24
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.869
Klaus Mager: maybe 3, 4, 5 years old. My parents had a restaurant, so they both worked in the evening.

25
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:56.809
Klaus Mager: and we had a TV that was had, I think, one or 2 channels, and the Allies forced the

26
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.720
Klaus Mager: Germans to to broadcast these images from the concentration camps, and from

27
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:20.029
Klaus Mager: so I remember as a little boy, I still still in my head? You know how you saw people untressing, queuing up in front of a ditch, getting shot in the head, you know, falling into a pile

28
00:04:20.562 --> 00:04:26.189
Klaus Mager: people being hung up on butcher hooks, I mean, just unbelievable stuff, you know.

29
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.000
Klaus Mager: So so I mean, that's and that was meant to

30
00:04:32.664 --> 00:04:37.665
Klaus Mager: make it clear to. This is what you guys did. Right?

31
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:51.450
Klaus Mager: so so for my generation, it was like, really, you guys did this sort of thing, you know, and and you found this normal. And

32
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.039
Klaus Mager: the surprising thing was the defensiveness of my parents, generation

33
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.726
Klaus Mager: to to reject, wanting to to see this as guilt, you know.

34
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:30.180
Klaus Mager: and so that the it was, it was actually really necessary for Germany to put in these laws that made it a crime to do a Hitler salute, or to repeat Nazi propaganda, and in hindsight that was really necessary to suppress that sentiment, you know, into.

35
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:39.420
Klaus Mager: to to force that kind of of shame on to onto the people in general. Right?

36
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:52.285
Klaus Mager: So it's a generational trauma that that will be, you know, forever stained and what you see today is

37
00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:05.179
Klaus Mager: a a generation that grew up, you know, after mine and and beyond, you know. So the millennials and and younger.

38
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:17.260
Klaus Mager: who who didn't fully get what this was. You know they they didn't see these images. They didn't feel the awareness of

39
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:25.190
Klaus Mager: it's so helpful we can talk about, of of all this. I mean, it's just

40
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.882
Klaus Mager: the when- when you when you

41
00:06:28.914 --> 00:06:46.199
Klaus Mager: see the the these images right? And then you talk with people like my dad's restaurant. They had this round table. It's called the Stumptish, you know where the regulars come and drink beer before they go home, or you know, in the evening.

42
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.800
Klaus Mager: and the the

43
00:06:50.170 --> 00:07:00.500
Klaus Mager: the conversations that that the way the way they rationalized this whole thing, you know, was just was just really incredible.

44
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:14.889
Klaus Mager: Well, and so so when I listen to, I was listening to Yuval Harari the other day. And he is saying, you know what's happening in Israel right now is is creating generational trauma.

45
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.013
Klaus Mager: This will, this will last is going. This will go into the history books and and

46
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:31.159
Klaus Mager: and and create a lot of pain. Now that is being is being really expressed now.

47
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.020
Klaus Mager: So yeah, it. It's it's

48
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:58.679
Klaus Mager: there is a collective mind, you know there is such a thing as a collective mind, and it's tribal, I would say, and and you you feel either pride or I mean on from the extremes, you know from you feel pride and belonging, or you feel shame, you know.

49
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.509
Klaus Mager: and it's no it's all in the same book.

50
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:06.116
Jerry Michalski: Klaus. Thank you.

51
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.349
Jerry Michalski: So many thoughts, so many different thoughts.

52
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.550
Jerry Michalski: There's some piece of

53
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:44.509
Jerry Michalski: showing the footage of the atrocities that is to anchor in the fact that this really happened, because what we're seeing is that many people will say, Oh, yeah. January 6th was not a that was a picnic that was a like a tourist in the capital, no big deal, and rewriting history in some sense. So so, having some sort of documentary evidence and making people see it feels like that, but it also has backlash. It also causes a whole bunch of other forces. And I'm

54
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:53.609
Jerry Michalski: I think that the dynamic is really interesting. One of the interesting thoughts in my notes in my brain is, How do you end wars? Well.

55
00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:13.559
Jerry Michalski: how do we process things? Well, because part of what I'm wondering is whether the different measures that were taken, including making it illegal to buy or sell Nazi paraphernalia do the sigheil, or whatever else those were. Those were made illegal, as you said. Did that

56
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.469
Jerry Michalski: suppress conversation and processing and grief?

57
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:32.030
Jerry Michalski: Or did that help by taking that off the table entirely, and I don't know what the answers are, but I think that those are calls that people made at a societal level, that we're still reckoning with in some sense right.

58
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:45.069
Klaus Mager: People were totally shell shocked about this, you know, and and and in, I think, in in, like my parents, know my mother, you know, in their mind is

59
00:09:45.290 --> 00:10:00.170
Klaus Mager: I wasn't the decision maker now, what was I supposed to do about it? And and so on. So this to experience. This kind of collective guilt is really a trip, I mean for me. Now I was studying in Paris, and

60
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:13.370
Klaus Mager: there were people who hated Germans absolutely hated them because they got traumatized during World War 2, you know, and I'm going well, hey? What do I have to do with it? Well, you're German, and so the the there is this

61
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:21.590
Klaus Mager: mid in Germany, you know. You're with it, you know. And so

62
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.519
Klaus Mager: the the yeah, I mean, my generation has this trauma.

63
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:43.800
Klaus Mager: you know, firsthand this this like. My God! I can't believe we did this, you know. And you guys did this, and you got captured in it, and your mind is still trapped in it, and you can't get out of it.

64
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.572
Klaus Mager: you know, and it's

65
00:10:47.028 --> 00:10:57.470
Klaus Mager: and the harder you push them, you know, the more defensive they get. And and because the pain is so is so raw. And so, you know, so so emotional.

66
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:05.734
Klaus Mager: it's a. It's a really tough. It's a really amazing thing. And the tragic. The tragedy is that

67
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.679
Klaus Mager: you're seeing it happening all over the world right now. Yeah.

68
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.500
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You're dramatizing. Oss! Now.

69
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.459
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. Thank you. That's that's exactly what I'm thinking. Kill. Please.

70
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.929
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, and hurt people hurt other people.

71
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:30.239
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There's a generational transmission of the pain my father fought in World War 2,

72
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.329
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and to his, I think to his last day would not buy anything German.

73
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.890
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So an example of that being carried. The

74
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:59.300
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I think of the truth and reconciliation commissions in South Africa, and the work being done in Canada, and the, you know, multi-century generational trauma in the Balkans that you saw flare in the 19 nineties in the world, in the wars there.

75
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.699
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Jerry. What you said about rewriting history is really, you know.

76
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.290
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: very present, because we're seeing a concerted effort to do that in this country right now.

77
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:24.499
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, as a matter of policy and thuggery and bribery in a you know, in a very systematic and organized way, with, you know, with surprisingly little pushback and effective defense against it. So there's that

78
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.960
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: it, you know, Klaus, you talked about the general generational grief being

79
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:48.850
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: what cultivated, I guess, in the Middle East right now. The trauma for the Gazans is obvious. The trauma for the Israelis is more complex. But what we're seeing rising suicide rates in Israel we're seeing more Israeli military people refusing to serve

80
00:12:49.010 --> 00:13:09.450
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: at a projection of what's going on. But the the huge thing in the background is that apparently I don't know if this is completely true. I hear this from folks is that Israeli news media is not fully covering the war. In other words, Israeli citizens are not seeing. It's like the Germans in a way like the Germans in World War 2. The Israeli citizens are not seeing the extent

81
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:23.490
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: of what's going on in Gaza, the implication being that if they did, there'd be more outrage than there's been. There's been considerable amount, but with very little political leverage in the political system they have there. So

82
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:30.216
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, at some point, when that comes out they'll be held to pay for that

83
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:43.540
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: other notable thing. I didn't see this in the time. I haven't seen the Times this morning, or the American papers this morning, but yesterday there was an announcement out of the UN. That the

84
00:13:45.420 --> 00:14:01.159
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: in addition to Britain and France, and now Canada, speaking about recognizing a Palestinian State yesterday, 17 countries, and the Arab League and the European Union, called on Hamas to disarm

85
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:16.869
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and to stand down from any political leadership in Palestinian territories was kind of stunning that the entire Arab League signed on to that. So you know the game is shifting. How you unravel the grief is a real mystery.

86
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.939
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: but pretty clearly not by denying it.

87
00:14:22.675 --> 00:14:24.960
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, there's I.

88
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:34.320
Jerry Michalski: I think we all form little models of how things work. And my own personal model is that processing grief well, often relieves

89
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:43.559
Jerry Michalski: different kinds of pressures in our heads and our minds, and I'm wondering how to do that at a societal level, because

90
00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:46.219
Jerry Michalski: we often

91
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:55.459
Jerry Michalski: famously, when soldiers come back from wars. Most many of them I don't know. I would love to know what the proportions are. Don't want to talk about the atrocities they saw or committed.

92
00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:10.660
Jerry Michalski: And so the stories go untold, and the next generation's like, well, guess there was a war, and their idea of war is Hollywood movies where there's heroes, and there's, you know, people go Boeing, and whatever or or worse

93
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:28.950
Jerry Michalski: games where you shoot people and then respawn and then shoot people some more. And then whatever which is a big piece of our culture today, you know, 1st person shooters or other kinds of games, and those create really warped senses of what all of this is. Matthew Grady, I think, is the photographer's name Brady.

94
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.079
Jerry Michalski: At during the Civil War

95
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:59.299
Jerry Michalski: the cameras were still slow, so there are no action shots of the Civil War. But he went to battlefields just after battles were ended, and famously at Antietam he published. They published news photos of bloated corpses in the gullies on the battlefield of Antietam, and until then everybody thought war was kind of glorious, because the way you saw war was. There were battle painters. There was actually a subgenre painting

96
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:19.581
Jerry Michalski: of people who would go near a battle stand on the hill and then paint what they heard and saw happen, and conflate different scenes, heroic scenes and charges, and whatever all sort of be represented, or they would be more like a newspaper illustrator. But but it was very different. You didn't see the the horror. Nobody was putting it right in front of you and and

97
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:43.310
Jerry Michalski: and that shocked everybody. People were really stunned by seeing war close up, and the the sheen of war which the militaries and governments build up all the time the fancy uniforms, the glory, the parades, all those kinds of things are a way of building up more wealth for the civic, for the population, and the military sort of fell away a bunch. Kevin.

98
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.749
Jerry Michalski: Oh, you're muted.

99
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.380
Kevin Jones: Okay.

100
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:57.790
Kevin Jones: yeah. I'm back in Swan and Noah. We fled from it for a couple of months in Europe to get away from the

101
00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.409
Kevin Jones: the trauma and sadness of the place, and I'm back

102
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:13.529
Kevin Jones: and in terms of people standing in with that, there's this sort of position that they want me to be in, and swanna grassroots, alliances

103
00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:19.910
Kevin Jones: helping coordinate the nascent Chamber of Commerce in Swaninawa.

104
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:41.479
Kevin Jones: and I'm backing away from it. And David Bils from his wife was similarly, after disaster, you suddenly get a lot of influence when nobody knew you before. And so they they asked her to be on boards and things. And and she said, There's just so much sadness she's backing away, and I am, too. We're gonna

105
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:52.580
Kevin Jones: rent a place in Asheville. One of the things I discovered in Europe is that I want to walk to a cafe rather than live out in the country, and that it became a whole

106
00:17:52.830 --> 00:18:05.028
Kevin Jones: really interesting thing. And so we're going to be urban, I think, and not rural. And kids are fighting over the property, which is whatever but

107
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.360
Kevin Jones: and I just don't want that kind of influence. And so

108
00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:30.869
Kevin Jones: our community is one of those been so decimated. There's no grocery store. There's maybe a little one starting. They've taken away our post office, you know. It's it's a that the people who you would expect to stand up just are backing away. It's too heavy. And so our, our, the weakness of our community is accentuating because the folks who stepped in post disaster

109
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.412
Kevin Jones: just can't do it anymore. And and I'm too old to do it. And and I I am,

110
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.789
Kevin Jones: you know, 75. But you know somebody to whom.

111
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:52.910
Kevin Jones: when I'm in a situation, power gravitates toward me. I have something that causes that to happen, and I'm just not taking it anymore. I don't want to lift up anything I want to write.

112
00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:06.089
Kevin Jones: and I don't want to have, you know, a local influence. That means I have to show up at meetings and then go to the City Hall or the county Commissioners to represent us, because, you know, we're a low status neighborhood still.

113
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:12.280
Kevin Jones: and we aren't getting our share of what you know from the county

114
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.903
Kevin Jones: from the State, from there is still this fema thing in some way or other, and

115
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:35.340
Kevin Jones: and so there's something that happens in a community where the folks who would stood up just can't do it. And that's where our community is kind of unraveling. And and I mean, I know of other people who are just not able to.

116
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:40.610
Kevin Jones: There are a couple of people who were still going, but many people who were

117
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:56.390
Kevin Jones: part of the relief cannot really stay for the reconstruction, because it's still so devastated, and the land was scoured, and our biodiversity was greatly compromised and compromised by the corps of engineers repair of the river which

118
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.920
Kevin Jones: just scraped it and scoured it. And so

119
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:10.869
Kevin Jones: So there's I'm in Swanina. But in in a couple of weeks we're gonna be back in this Airbnb that. And we're we're gonna

120
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.069
Kevin Jones: I don't want to be sort of the

121
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:21.470
Kevin Jones: rural squire in the community trying. I can't can't handle it. And and so many other people who were doing it

122
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.070
Kevin Jones: can't do it. I mean, there's there's something around the

123
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:35.690
Kevin Jones: the progressive fraying of our social fabric, and that'd be interesting to see what happens with other post-disaster places like that.

124
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:52.329
Kevin Jones: There's a great Marshall high studios you should follow on Instagram. They're wonderful. They're up in Marshall which was totally decimated. But there's a little artist collective on this island, teeny little island that has been restoring itself and getting volunteers, and and they've got enough of a

125
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.729
Kevin Jones: thing where they're in a really smaller community. They're building

126
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.982
Kevin Jones: resilience and and and repairing this great old school.

127
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:14.697
Kevin Jones: and people are getting engaged with it, and you can follow what the artists are doing. But the artists are building their community, and they're trying to imagine Marshall, you know, and they're putting in food trucks and things like that. And

128
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:21.129
Kevin Jones: there, there's not a way that I can imagine to imagine someone at all. So.

129
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.400
Jerry Michalski: File.

130
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.670
Kevin Jones: That's just sad.

131
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.019
Jerry Michalski: In in Oregon. There's a family called Mcmenamins

132
00:21:31.360 --> 00:22:00.299
Jerry Michalski: that I might have mentioned in a couple of Ogm. Calls before, but they are. I think it's 2 brothers and a sister who, years ago started buying up derelict properties, and one of the 1st that they bought up was the poor farm that had been idled. That was 15 min east of the airport, so Portland itself is west of the airport, a little southwest and east of the airport. Just a little ways is this property called Edgefield. I have an Edgefield T-shirt from there, and they then

133
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:15.400
Jerry Michalski: converted these properties into fabulous venues, and Edgefield is thriving. It's got a hotel, 2 restaurants, 3 bars, a bowling alley, a movie theater, a Spa, a vineyard.

134
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:26.830
Jerry Michalski: a performance venue outdoors with a stage, with a major stage and a rolling lawn that goes down to the to the where, the stages and all that. And and the place is great. It's a it's a concert venue, and all that.

135
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:45.039
Jerry Michalski: I live downtown Portland walking distance. We love walkability. And so there are 5 Mcmenamins properties within walking distance of our town, and then we stayed at a Mcmenin's property in Tacoma or Seattle a couple years ago, called Anderson School, and it was an elementary school that they had taken over. They've done this a lot.

136
00:22:45.080 --> 00:23:00.900
Jerry Michalski: And we heard the story that that neighborhood had basically been impoverished and was not doing well until they went in and refurbed the Anderson school. And suddenly, when you drive in now, there's a bunch of buildings and restaurants, and that the place that that corner of

137
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:15.960
Jerry Michalski: the whole Seattle Tacoma area is thriving is doing fine, and I say all of this because I wish there were more Mcmenan equivalents in communities all around the world that they've got a thriving business

138
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:34.600
Jerry Michalski: restoring places, Masonic halls, libraries. They just find stuff and then work their magic on it, and they have a lovely aesthetic. The menu is roughly the same in all their properties. They make their own beer, wine, distilled spirits, a whole bunch of stuff, anyway. It's kind of a minor miracle.

139
00:23:34.988 --> 00:23:41.090
Jerry Michalski: And I'm happy to talk about something positive, because it's just sad to hear stories of how

140
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.703
Jerry Michalski: exhausted people get when they're trying to recover from something. So, Major.

141
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:57.679
Jerry Michalski: and I feel I, Kevin, to feel for you. It's your community which you love was just ripped.

142
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.460
Kevin Jones: Yeah. And and you know

143
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:14.980
Kevin Jones: David's wife and and I, our story ripples with each other and and enables other people to walk away from holding the community together.

144
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.990
Kevin Jones: and it's just a

145
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:29.195
Kevin Jones: you know. The devastation is so severe, and we'll be there for years. You will drive by it every day on the way to where you go, and it's just being immersed in in destruction is just

146
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.299
Kevin Jones: just can't deal with it, you know.

147
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.620
Kevin Jones: you know our our farm is.

148
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:56.130
Kevin Jones: and grass is growing, you know, there, and the river cane is growing, but it's you know it'll never be where we that's where we were gonna grow old. And now we've got to find a way to sell it because our kids don't want to agree. Then my kids can't agree on the future next to each other. So

149
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:04.625
Kevin Jones: you know, it's you know, it worked for 15 years, and you know then it didn't. I mean, I have less to complain about than other folks, but it's just

150
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.669
Kevin Jones: place is too damn sad to hang on.

151
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.890
Jerry Michalski: Yeah. Thanks. Kevin, yeah. Close, please.

152
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.960
Klaus Mager: Yeah, we'll do. We'll do.

153
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.330
Klaus Mager: Does show really is the need

154
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:35.379
Klaus Mager: to have support services in place. I mean, here in Oregon we had these devastating fires around the 20 corridor, going from bend to to Salem and to Portland, and entire communities got wiped out, I mean, just burned down. There wasn't a single house still standing.

155
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:58.270
Klaus Mager: And when you drive through today all new homes, you know, it's all recovered. It's clean again. And that happened because the State mobilized, you know, a support structure that helped everybody. They got Rvs to live in for a while and got assistance to rebuild their homes in a in a safer place.

156
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:09.390
Klaus Mager: and I think, you know, like with Fema being so handicapped. And you have people in cabinet positions who are so inadequately prepared

157
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:15.970
Klaus Mager: to deal with these kinds of emergencies and and support systems that are required.

158
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:35.889
Klaus Mager: And then you go. What happened to us? You know, I mean, what what happened to our Psyche. You know that all of a sudden we we are walking away from from people in need, and and don't really don't really try. You know it's this

159
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.660
Klaus Mager: idea that just let them swim on their own, since swimmers

160
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.499
Klaus Mager: swim or sink. Kind of mentality.

161
00:26:44.008 --> 00:26:52.359
Klaus Mager: But that's what what Kevin is saying, I mean, there is outside help required for people who come in from a safe space

162
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.809
Klaus Mager: and engage, and if that's missing

163
00:26:56.326 --> 00:27:11.380
Klaus Mager: then we're in for a really bad time. Because these storm systems and and devastations are not gonna subside. Right? I mean, we're just moving into climate change. It's just really, it's just a matter. It's just

164
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.689
Klaus Mager: pure luck if we don't get hit by a major storm this year. Yeah.

165
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:39.369
Klaus Mager: And then what? What's going to happen? Who who is even mentally prepared to deal with this now in this administrative leadership, and not just the administration, I mean, when you think the philosophy behind it. You know the Heritage Foundation, the project 2025, I mean, all these ideas are so alien

166
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:47.459
Klaus Mager: to to a modern society, you know, in a an empathic society.

167
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:54.730
Klaus Mager: It's it's it's really. It's really confounding to to where we're going here.

168
00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:05.020
Jerry Michalski: So, thanks, thanks for bringing into the conversation the thing that lurks through many of our many of our calls here, which is the pending

169
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:16.690
Jerry Michalski: worst disasters of climate change and and other things. But really, how climate change is going to keep doing this, and it's just going to do this more and more at a at a scale where human intervention seems

170
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.409
Jerry Michalski: puny, ineffectual, whatever else. And I think it's it's going to be demoralizing.

171
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.710
Jerry Michalski: It's going to be overwhelming.

172
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:31.039
Jerry Michalski: And I'm still. I'm still thinking that the the

173
00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:42.209
Jerry Michalski: positive processing of grief might help a bit in this might help get us back together might help build up our ability to

174
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:52.700
Jerry Michalski: build new. I don't. I don't know. And I think I might be just being overly optimistic here. But I'm interested in the role grief has in in these kinds of things. Eric, please.

175
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.310
Eric Rangell: Yeah, Hi, so

176
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:10.130
Eric Rangell: the way I can relate to historical events like World War 2 is through movies. And I posted a few movie references. But

177
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:26.199
Eric Rangell: what I just realized is for my generation, Gen. X. 9, 11, 2,001, was the event that most connected my generation with devastation and grief.

178
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.309
Eric Rangell: and I worked in New York.

179
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:40.120
Eric Rangell: And I took the trains path trains and saw the wreckage.

180
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.280
Eric Rangell: And

181
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:52.949
Eric Rangell: Now, what I'm wondering is. That was almost 25 years ago, and that probably woke up a lot of us to the threats of

182
00:29:53.090 --> 00:30:02.770
Eric Rangell: the what we hold dear being destroyed. But now we're seeing the more destruction.

183
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:09.840
Eric Rangell: And I think there's something very different now about what we're seeing

184
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.749
Eric Rangell: then like, it's almost like we could put 9 11 on the shelf.

185
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:25.700
Eric Rangell: If if that's what it feels like that, even though we felt it at the time, it's like right now. There's something more immediate and

186
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.510
Eric Rangell: hurting that in these recent tragedies.

187
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.020
Eric Rangell: And I mean.

188
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:47.697
Eric Rangell: now, there was a movie called Worth about how to compensate families of 9, 11 victims. And that's very thought provoking. But

189
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:57.019
Eric Rangell: it's still an economic perspective from a lawyer who had to do this. But

190
00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:02.980
Eric Rangell: yeah, what is worth of human life these days.

191
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:11.149
Eric Rangell: And yeah, they, how do we? As humans cope with tragedies?

192
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:20.069
Eric Rangell: I mean, there's always an outpouring at the beginning of donations. And then there's all kinds of scams you gotta watch out for.

193
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:29.709
Eric Rangell: So I think a lot of people can disconnect from helping if or limit

194
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:38.310
Eric Rangell: helping. And I know that's a tendency in me to step back, and other than

195
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:48.980
Eric Rangell: but eventually, that guy may be in a meeting where somebody recommends a charity that's doing more specific work in a specific region. And then I would donate to that.

196
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:59.430
Eric Rangell: So yeah, there's a

197
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:07.169
Eric Rangell: okay. I think we can learn from some of these movies like forgiving Dr. Mangela

198
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:19.859
Eric Rangell: and the others that I recommended. The recent one was the zone of interest. Realizing that any of us could have become Nazis if we were in that environment.

199
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.679
Eric Rangell: That's a psychological thing in human nature.

200
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:32.520
Eric Rangell: So let's understand ourselves, our humanity and our fellow human.

201
00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:37.200
Eric Rangell: the the humanity in our fellows and be there for each other.

202
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.280
Eric Rangell: Thank you.

203
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.340
Jerry Michalski: Hmm.

204
00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:47.930
Jerry Michalski: thank you, Eric. Can. Can you just talk a little bit more when you said we? We seem to have put, or we put 9, 11 on the shelf.

205
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.500
Jerry Michalski: Can you say more? What you mean by that? And what effect it had.

206
00:32:51.890 --> 00:33:14.060
Eric Rangell: Okay. I think it is a distant memory in a lot of people who weren't immediately impacted by it. And I have a feeling that it's not being taught in schools, or as much as it was in the past. So I have a feeling that the young generation is not sensing that

207
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:22.430
Eric Rangell: the immediate devastation and what it did for us as a country, the

208
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:34.390
Eric Rangell: the real hit it took. Because, yeah, so like, there's reactions to to events around the world.

209
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.809
Eric Rangell: But still a lot of Americans feel still feel safe

210
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.640
Eric Rangell: somewhat, except for these random acts of violence that we experience.

211
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:51.530
Jerry Michalski: Stochastic violence or stochastic terrorism, or whatever we call it. It's funny, though, because

212
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.940
Jerry Michalski: 9 11 was a highly focused, brief

213
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.529
Jerry Michalski: incident of violence that took 3,000. Some lives.

214
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:09.529
Jerry Michalski: in relation to that. The Fentanyl epidemic and other sorts of things have taken enormous lives, and every day claim a whole series of lives that we don't

215
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:16.030
Jerry Michalski: sort of grieve or pay attention to, or else there's like other kinds of of

216
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.899
Jerry Michalski: horrible events happening that that we're in some sense.

217
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:48.499
Jerry Michalski: there's enough bad stuff happening. And our, it's it's availability to us on instant basis because of the superconductivity of the Internet and the availability and everybody carrying a high definition, camera, etc, etc. We are suddenly immersed in things that ought to be causing us to grieve more and yet an over supply of all these negative stimuli, I think, inures us

218
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.889
Jerry Michalski: to pain and suffering, and we will, you know

219
00:34:53.130 --> 00:35:09.839
Jerry Michalski: the the 1st couple ads when Sally fields was on with running children, asking people to donate to save the children. Those are probably pretty effective, and all all of that wears off over time because we wear out over time. We can't. We can't stay in.

220
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.110
Jerry Michalski: Well.

221
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:19.169
Jerry Michalski: I think I think we can't stay in grief for very long, or we're not processing grief. Well, we don't.

222
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:31.859
Jerry Michalski: We don't actually face it really. Well, the backlash right now. The rewriting of history we were just talking about is going to inflict trauma on a whole bunch of people who thought things were getting a little bit better because their stories were being told.

223
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.090
Jerry Michalski: Their ancestor stories were being told that that's all. Been shoved back in the closet now.

224
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:43.270
Jerry Michalski: And I'm really interested in processes that make things better.

225
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:51.909
Jerry Michalski: Any other thoughts on societal, large scale collective grief, its effects.

226
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.369
Jerry Michalski: Where we've come from all that.

227
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.859
Klaus Mager: I mean, it's everywhere. I've been traveled to Chile and Argentina last year.

228
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:13.580
Klaus Mager: and this this old scholar, you know, and they always invite really interesting speakers, mostly academics.

229
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:24.560
Klaus Mager: and chile still is traumatized today by pinochet. And what what happened during this time? I mean, it's amazing. Every conversation, you know where

230
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:52.180
Klaus Mager: a little bit deeper, and when you go with Rhodes Scholar, this is always a little bit more intellectual. And and, boy, I mean every single one of the docents was like, right here, you know this pinochet, what happened, and the disappearance, and in Argentina the disappearance of so many and the the grieving mothers are still circling.

231
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.720
Klaus Mager: I mean, it's everywhere, you know. This is just

232
00:36:56.141 --> 00:37:01.289
Klaus Mager: there was a there was a time of hope, I think, in our generation now the

233
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:23.229
Klaus Mager: the hippie era, the seventies and and sixties, seventies, and so on. No more war. And and even so it was. It was more like a fantasy. But it was at least this idea, you know, that we can create a better world. But we haven't really succeeded. And when you look around the world.

234
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:37.590
Klaus Mager: it seems, seems to be deeply embedded in our nature, and to not just on an individual level. But this collective trauma that we're causing you know, and that we just can't find leadership

235
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:52.183
Klaus Mager: that is, empathic and and caring, you know, and it seems to be so deeply embedded in our in our nature that we

236
00:37:53.090 --> 00:38:13.430
Klaus Mager: that we just, you know, accumulate and and want, and you know and and use violence, and and this this kind of reckless lack of of empathy, that that is this prevalent in a significant share of the population.

237
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.390
Jerry Michalski: I sorry. Are you done?

238
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.970
Klaus Mager: Yeah.

239
00:38:18.895 --> 00:38:23.030
Jerry Michalski: I grew up partly in Buenos Aires, Argentina when I was 11 and 12,

240
00:38:23.777 --> 00:38:30.939
Jerry Michalski: which is a while ago. And we left basically, just before the dirty war started.

241
00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:40.909
Jerry Michalski: and the whole situation on this, on the ground in Argentina, was was just spiraling downward quickly. A couple months before we left 5 guys with guns held us up at home.

242
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:50.300
Jerry Michalski: ushered us to the basement, robbed, ransacked the house, stole a lot of stuff, turns out they robbed 5 houses that evening, including the next door neighbors.

243
00:38:50.530 --> 00:39:13.969
Jerry Michalski: There's a whole long story about it. But then I went back to Argentina right out of grad school fresh over the fresh Mba. The 1st little project I had was in Buenos Aires, working for Russell Acoff, one of the founders of systems, thinking he needed. Somebody who understood his ideas, spoke Spanish, and had a little time available, and I had exactly a little window before I started my real 1st job.

244
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:30.490
Jerry Michalski: and I went down and and loved my time in Argentina then, and just before leaving the people gave me a copy of the book titled Nunca Mas, which means Never again. And it was basically the report of the Commission on Disappeared persons

245
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:45.369
Jerry Michalski: which have been published widely across the country, and Argentina is famous for their truth and reconciliation process, post dirty war, where people who had tortured and killed people got some degree of amnesty in exchange for telling all the truth

246
00:39:46.220 --> 00:40:04.399
Jerry Michalski: like if they discovered that you had told a partial truth, and then you could still be convicted for things you didn't confess to. But if you confess to things, you would be treated very differently. And so there was a purgative moment of accepting that these things had happened. And then, later, as DNA evidence came in.

247
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:17.790
Jerry Michalski: All of a sudden they started discovering that a lot of the kids, born from women who were kidnapped and disappeared had been placed with conservative families and the DNA testing, now allowed people to discover their grandchildren

248
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:28.240
Jerry Michalski: and meet again and figure out, oh, my God! You were doing what? Which is happening right now with Ukrainian children in Russia. By the by, exactly the same, exactly the same pattern.

249
00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.510
Jerry Michalski: And

250
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:56.449
Jerry Michalski: all of this was healing. And yeah, I'm never quite sure when the healing is done, what works? I had a conversation with a friend in South Africa a few years back, and he was like, Yeah, we talk about the South African truth and reconciliation commissions. But the situation there's practical apartheid in South Africa to this day. It's not. It hasn't worked well. It's not. It didn't solve problems here. And I'm I'm

251
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.680
Jerry Michalski: troubled by all these dynamics.

252
00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.760
Jerry Michalski: Is this to set a topic.

253
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:11.019
Jerry Michalski: do we? Do we want to not dip into it, do we? How

254
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:38.959
Jerry Michalski: how do we cope? I'm very aware of and sympathetic to the overwhelm of bad news that we are living in today, and you know Ken subscribes to one or more good news services. I think if you want to post links to them in the chat, please do. There's ways of shifting your gaze, shifting your attention. There's also ways of just working in the world where what you work toward is positive change with anybody who will show up.

255
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.769
Jerry Michalski: which I think is a fabulous way of working.

256
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:54.770
Jerry Michalski: But but I fear that, ignoring the grief, sorry I'm going to go personal again for a sec. One of the errors my parents and grandparents made was not telling me the difficult stories of our family history.

257
00:41:54.970 --> 00:42:12.209
Jerry Michalski: They never shared them. They all wanted me to be happy and have a happy life and a happy childhood, and when I was old enough to bear the weight of some of the stories a big mistake I made with my maternal grandparents in particular, who I adored and who adored me, was not to sit them down and say, okay, guys.

258
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:36.030
Jerry Michalski: I'm old enough. I can take it. Tell me everything, and turn on recorder and and record all of that, because it's gone. Now all my ancestors have passed away, and I'm doing detective work to try to figure out what those stories were. But it's not nearly the same as actually hearing it firsthand, and I have a suspicion that hearing these things firsthand would have caused me to make different decisions earlier in life.

259
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:45.499
Jerry Michalski: because I would have understood better the weight of history and actions, and my family's role, and all those kinds of things. Eric, please.

260
00:42:50.040 --> 00:43:11.480
Eric Rangell: So I want to share a tradition that Jews use for coping, and it's really embedded. The grief is embedded throughout the whole life cycle that, like even in happy occasions, there's always some bittersweet memories that are acknowledged.

261
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:35.819
Eric Rangell: And we're coming up on a holiday called Tishaba, of which is this weekend, and that's a fast day when Jews remember the destructions of the temples and all the coincidental events that happened on that day since those times the tragic days.

262
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.930
Eric Rangell: And

263
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:50.269
Eric Rangell: So even in happy music there's never a perfect happiness. There's always a sense of Oi in everything, and I think that if

264
00:43:51.090 --> 00:44:01.300
Eric Rangell: that could be a model of yeah, always acknowledging the grief while other throughout the life cycle

265
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.399
Eric Rangell: cause yeah, baby's born. But there's also funerals.

266
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:13.359
Eric Rangell: And it's that wholeness that this is a whole living life fully.

267
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:21.630
Eric Rangell: Now, I also think that forgiveness is a very powerful thing when it's used properly.

268
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:43.890
Eric Rangell: I mean that movie forgiving. Dr. Mengele is about a twin who was used by Nazi experiments, and her sister was totally destroyed. Her health was totally destroyed from it, but she drew strength from her experience and

269
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:52.850
Eric Rangell: went on to build a museum in Indiana, and that museum was destroyed in a fire.

270
00:44:53.050 --> 00:45:03.080
Eric Rangell: but she had it rebuilt, and she's dedicated her life to teaching about the holocaust.

271
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.420
Eric Rangell: So

272
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:25.950
Eric Rangell: I think we need more examples of what good can come out of tragedy that needs to be elevated more in the public consciousness, and people need to know they're not alone in whatever their grief they're going through at the time, it's got to be part of the just growing up experience.

273
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.330
Eric Rangell: So.

274
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:34.000
Eric Rangell: But that's just where I am now. I yeah, thanks.

275
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.030
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

276
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.219
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

277
00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:39.679
Jerry Michalski: We people need to be heard.

278
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.020
Jerry Michalski: They need to feel like they've been heard, and if they don't, if they aren't.

279
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:48.079
Jerry Michalski: Then things fester. It's not good. It doesn't end up. Well.

280
00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:03.820
Jerry Michalski: Where do y'all want to take this topic? If anywhere we can shift topics, we have a bunch of time left on this call. I'm noticing we're we're stiller than usual.

281
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:06.870
Jerry Michalski: and I'm not quite sure why.

282
00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:14.169
Jerry Michalski: if you wanna just check in with where this topic is taking you. Stacy.

283
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.160
Stacey Druss: Yeah.

284
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:24.650
Stacey Druss: this is, excuse me, this is really hard for me to say, especially because I'm the only woman on this call.

285
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.900
Stacey Druss: But I want to share that I'm really

286
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.189
Stacey Druss: God. I'm moved by so much of what was said, but

287
00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:39.759
Stacey Druss: particularly what's sticking with me is what Klaus mentioned about the denial piece.

288
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:45.140
Stacey Druss: I mean some. Actually. So

289
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:53.889
Stacey Druss: I've been. I wouldn't call it grieving because I'm caught in that acceptance stage.

290
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.150
Stacey Druss: But something that is being ignored

291
00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:05.200
Stacey Druss: is, you know, and I'm trying to figure out a way to make it light. So I'm calling it manonucleosis, which is the killing disease.

292
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:06.190
Jerry Michalski: Hmm.

293
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:08.075
Stacey Druss: But

294
00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:17.419
Stacey Druss: because of what was said about denial and not wanting to look at things.

295
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:25.239
Stacey Druss: I think we need to recognize that more than 80% of violent crimes are perpetrated by men.

296
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:30.119
Stacey Druss: And I think we need to look more deeply into that.

297
00:47:30.942 --> 00:47:38.210
Stacey Druss: So I'm kind of upset. Because recently I've been listening to a woman who was trafficked as a child.

298
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:48.839
Stacey Druss: and it's really important to hear those stories. And yes, but what I am really wanting to turn the

299
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:54.250
Stacey Druss: telescope on, to use Doug's phrase is.

300
00:47:54.980 --> 00:48:02.490
Stacey Druss: where do these young boys that wind up going into these networks of people?

301
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.880
Stacey Druss: Where are they coming from.

302
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:14.140
Stacey Druss: And I'm really believing that a lot of what we're seeing, whether it be in government or whatever a lot of it is blackmail based

303
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:26.859
Stacey Druss: people being put in compromising positions that may not have been willing to cross a line, but it looks as if they did, and so they can be blackmailed in that way.

304
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:34.139
Stacey Druss: I want to just go back to the culture and the idea that where it starts because

305
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:41.639
Stacey Druss: I'm not saying everybody is bad, not saying that at all. What I'm saying is, there's something in our system

306
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:47.270
Stacey Druss: that allows for structures.

307
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:58.239
Stacey Druss: I was married to somebody, and he used to joke that he fights. He would, he would joke. We would have very

308
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:05.730
Stacey Druss: rough arguments, and those of you that know me well can probably imagine that I can be quite. I can be pretty fierce.

309
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:10.940
Stacey Druss: but he would joke about it, and he would say, I fight to win

310
00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.640
Stacey Druss: now to him, fighting to win. He killed our family.

311
00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.010
Stacey Druss: I was not.

312
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:25.400
Stacey Druss: I did not kill our family. I escaped our family, and there's a difference.

313
00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:29.149
Stacey Druss: Not once did I call him fat, bald, and ugly, which

314
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:33.730
Stacey Druss: by all accounts he probably is. I just had to say that. Sorry

315
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.069
Stacey Druss: I've held it in forever. No.

316
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.430
Jerry Michalski: To process these things.

317
00:49:37.918 --> 00:49:41.339
Stacey Druss: Well, that's where the communication comes in.

318
00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:51.480
Stacey Druss: I think that's where where I'm centered right now. I'm trying to figure out. What do I do with this grief that I have.

319
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:58.139
Stacey Druss: and I know there's something called 3 C's, which is, choose, connect, and communicate

320
00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:05.929
Stacey Druss: for me. I know I need to be communicating more, and that is probably going to be through writing. But to go back to my original point.

321
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.180
Stacey Druss: if we don't look at

322
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:18.269
Stacey Druss: it could be something simple, like how many? How many men have covered for their friends when their friends have been having an affair?

323
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:21.610
Stacey Druss: How many?

324
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:33.940
Stacey Druss: One of my earliest memories was this boy. He was probably about 9, because I was probably about 5, and he was collecting frogs in a jar.

325
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:43.540
Stacey Druss: and he used to call himself the doctor. He wanted to be a doctor when he was older, and he was collecting these frogs in the jar so that he could suffocate them.

326
00:50:43.680 --> 00:51:00.839
Stacey Druss: and he was hanging out with my cousins, and I remember crying and begging them to please let the frogs go, and I remember going to my grandfather. I don't remember what everybody said. Maybe one person weekly said, I just let them go.

327
00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:06.100
Stacey Druss: But why didn't everyone look at that boy and say what the hell is wrong with you.

328
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:22.740
Stacey Druss: and I guess that's what I'm calling for. I'm calling for. I'm calling for men to really protect women. And the way a man really protects women is to speak out against injustice in their own circles.

329
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:34.560
Stacey Druss: you know. And I know you guys are not the ones that need to hear this message, you know. I mean, I'm sure you've seen it, though I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. But you guys are where it starts.

330
00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:36.349
Stacey Druss: and then it filters out.

331
00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:41.480
Stacey Druss: I was listening to 2 right wing Podcasters, Vinnie and Adam

332
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:55.199
Stacey Druss: and Vinnie to his credit, even though I you know to his credit. He's like, you know, with this Epstein thing he's saying, I don't care if our government falls apart. I don't care. Yes, lock them all up.

333
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.980
Stacey Druss: But the other guy, Adam, is saying, Well.

334
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.570
Stacey Druss: do you really want that to happen?

335
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:12.109
Stacey Druss: And that kind of mentality that is willing to overlook children being abused like this.

336
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:19.109
Stacey Druss: Let's let's look at who these abusers are, because I think the scary part is, we're going to find out

337
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:26.500
Stacey Druss: that they're all over, and they're like we're like. We may not be looking at them like abusers.

338
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.120
Stacey Druss: but every time you cover for somebody doing the wrong thing

339
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.770
Stacey Druss: every time you laugh at something, instead of saying.

340
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.279
Stacey Druss: What do you really believe that

341
00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:43.590
Stacey Druss: you're part of that system, and me too? So when I say you know

342
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:50.159
Stacey Druss: all of us. So thank you. I know I just rambled a lot, but it just

343
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:55.359
Stacey Druss: we have to look at this power dynamic

344
00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.319
Stacey Druss: that's built into our institutions. And oh, and that's the last point.

345
00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:06.279
Stacey Druss: even like we find out, like a teacher doing something wrong.

346
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:19.559
Stacey Druss: that school is looking to protect their image. So we also need to look at the way institutions are protecting perpetrators, families protect perpetrators.

347
00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:31.419
Stacey Druss: I've had women tell me about. Luckily I've never been abused. Thank God, I with all the craziness in my family. I was always loved and protected, but I've had actually. I've had one man, too.

348
00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:36.600
Stacey Druss: Talk to me about how they were abused by somebody in their own family

349
00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:41.460
Stacey Druss: and told to keep quiet, because it'll destroy the family.

350
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:48.799
Stacey Druss: So you know, to get to what Kevin was saying about people not wanting to be in that heaviness

351
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.789
Stacey Druss: I'm guilty of that.

352
00:53:51.280 --> 00:54:00.130
Stacey Druss: I'm guilty. I've tried to stay away from this topic for a really long time. It's hard and it's heavy. It's easier when you do it in a group.

353
00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.220
Stacey Druss: I'll stop now. Thank you.

354
00:54:06.175 --> 00:54:07.510
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Stacey.

355
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.449
Jerry Michalski: I I appreciate your directing

356
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:20.620
Jerry Michalski: our attention to the fact that men commit most of the acts of violence. I think that to be true.

357
00:54:21.334 --> 00:54:39.759
Jerry Michalski: There's a there's an underlying question sort of flowing next to our conversation, which is about nature or nurture some people I have some friends who are like, you can't change human nature. This is just the way things are. And I'm more of the wow. Our our culture and our society.

358
00:54:39.950 --> 00:55:04.840
Jerry Michalski: and how we socialize people affects people's beliefs and behaviors so deeply that we can turn into very different humans, really different kinds of humans. I don't think that human nature is. You know, life is nasty, brutish, and short. The other people are always the enemy. We're very tribal, so we always hate the enemy. I don't think those things are true. I think those things are cultural and social, and that's just that's only my perspective on it.

359
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:20.499
Jerry Michalski: but I think these questions and our internal answers to them dictate a lot how we respond to these situations, what we do, whether we feel any sense of agency. If it's just human nature, is your answer.

360
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:33.040
Jerry Michalski: So you don't have a lot of agency there. You resign yourself to the fact that these things are just going to happen over and over again. If you look at the historical record. That's kind of true. There's been lots of violence, much of it unnecessary over the years.

361
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:38.610
Jerry Michalski: and there's likely to be more especially the era, the era that we're marching into Gil. Please.

362
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:39.320
Jerry Michalski: Can I?

363
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.640
Jerry Michalski: Sorry, Stacey Stacey, go ahead.

364
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:57.210
Stacey Druss: Just real quick, because I think that if we look at the violence against nature, that's a great starting point. And I'm even thinking about the 1st time a little kid sees a bunch of ants on the ground. There are some people that are going to encourage their kid. Oh, kill them.

365
00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.639
Stacey Druss: and there are others that are going to look at them with wonder.

366
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.690
Stacey Druss: And I think that if we start there and just bring the questions to the surface.

367
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.320
Stacey Druss: Maybe things would be different over.

368
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.470
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Stacey.

369
00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:17.350
Stacey Druss: You're muted, Gil.

370
00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:17.856
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yup! Yup!

371
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:25.029
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: What you just said. Stacy reminded me of the amazing Susan Griffin book, the title of which I'm blanking on.

372
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:26.330
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Purple stones.

373
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.630
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Huh!

374
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:29.139
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Circle of stones.

375
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.569
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I think.

376
00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:33.750
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No, it's subtitled. The roaring inside her.

377
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:37.679
Jerry Michalski: Woman and nature, the roaring inside her.

378
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:45.130
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, which speaks to what Stacey was saying. You know the the. There's a lot of hatred for women in Maga Land

379
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.540
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: in the midst of the general cruelty that's playing out there.

380
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:56.530
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and I think Susan draws the connection of violence against nature and violence against women

381
00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:17.160
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: as generative source there. So, anyhow. Just the last minute, thought the human nature conversation I find really troubling and simplistic. My view of human nature is that it's vast and diverse, and contains all possibilities. And that's certainly the argument that Graber and Wengrow make in the dawn of everything.

382
00:57:17.743 --> 00:57:33.016
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, and we have people who will murder their neighbors without blinking an eye, and we have people who will run into a burning building to rescue strangers, and both of those are human nature, and the question is, you know, what do we cultivate, and how do we cultivate it?

383
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:42.330
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: To the, to the assertion that the majority of violence comes from men. I would add to that that it seems to come from young men.

384
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:52.170
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and one of the speculations about the substantial decline in murder rates and other crime in the United States over the last 20 years has been because of a demographic shift of reducing numbers of young men.

385
00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.170
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So

386
00:57:53.700 --> 00:58:16.789
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: make of that what you will. I don't know what we do with that, but what I really wanted to respond to was Stacy's comment about the role of all of us, and I've seen a number of posts lately that talk about our our individual agency and lack thereof of you know how many times have any of us heard a, you know, misogynistic or racist joke.

387
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:23.569
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and either laughed or suppressed a laugh, or turned away, but not confronted, or stepped into the conversation. Say, wait a minute.

388
00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.749
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, especially if it's a friend.

389
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:40.189
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: especially if it's a friend acting out of the habits that they've learned over years, maybe not even thoughtfully. There's opportunities for that kind of intervention all the time, everywhere of stepping and saying, Oh, you know, that's not okay. What you just said is not okay.

390
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:47.080
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And that obviously doesn't change the vast political landscape. But it's 1 of the places where we start

391
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:50.520
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and you know where we are with what we have.

392
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:54.920
Jerry Michalski: Scott.

393
00:58:57.610 --> 00:58:58.660
Jerry Michalski: Yes, you.

394
00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.960
Scott Moehring: Yeah. Howdy?

395
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.040
Jerry Michalski: Howdy!

396
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:10.760
Scott Moehring: So with my universals, frameworks of framework, of frameworks. You're talking about agency. What can

397
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:17.330
Scott Moehring: the loss of agency? And one of the themes I came to. It's it's a phrase I've actually put on the

398
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.170
Scott Moehring: the top card in my little deck.

399
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.869
Scott Moehring: What can I do?

400
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:30.220
Scott Moehring: And what's interesting? What I love about this phrase is, it can be, what can I do?

401
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:32.689
Scott Moehring: It's a total surrender.

402
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.150
Scott Moehring: What can I do?

403
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.400
Scott Moehring: Can also be what can I do.

404
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:46.480
Scott Moehring: It's exactly the same phrase, and that's a call to agency and to to

405
00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.990
Scott Moehring: taking action, to standing up to saying what you

406
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:55.429
Scott Moehring: what you should say, what you know. You should say what you could say, all of that.

407
00:59:55.910 --> 01:00:03.250
Scott Moehring: And as just a reflection on that, the one of the things that kicked this off for me in 2019

408
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:09.150
Scott Moehring: was looking up the Google Ngram, which is

409
01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:18.630
Scott Moehring: the history or the the frequency of word use inside of all the books that are have been scanned over the last I don't know. 100

410
01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:21.400
Scott Moehring: 100 plus years goes back to 1,800,

411
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.840
Scott Moehring: and the word I looked up was helpless.

412
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.489
Scott Moehring: and the graph was kind of like this, and then hit 2,000.

413
01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:34.429
Scott Moehring: And the frequency of the word helpless did a hockey stick basically at the end.

414
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:44.589
Scott Moehring: And you can. You can try it today. And the the other word to to put in counter to that was agency, and it had exactly the opposite shape

415
01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:48.380
Scott Moehring: going along. Hit 2,000, and down it went.

416
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:56.289
Scott Moehring: And I think that that's it's just. It's interesting to me, because I think books follow.

417
01:00:56.730 --> 01:01:01.090
Scott Moehring: It's like a dictionary. It follows the language, you know. Books follow the culture.

418
01:01:01.985 --> 01:01:05.476
Scott Moehring: I think more so than then lead

419
01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:15.010
Scott Moehring: and they're just kind of that. The wake in the water right? And I think that's an interesting trend. So

420
01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:24.040
Scott Moehring: it's hard to tell Gil on the chart, because the you know, it's 1,800 to to current.

421
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.260
Scott Moehring: you know. So it's like at some point around the 2 thousands. Yes.

422
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.399
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Might be able to adjust the time range on it. Why I'm asking is because I suspect.

423
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:36.889
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: don't know if this is true, but I suspect that the plummet comes after the after the 9 11 attacks.

424
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.140
Scott Moehring: That's a very interesting insight. I don't know, but I would suspect that

425
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.000
Scott Moehring: that was one of the factors.

426
01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:51.630
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, I mean that that certainly shook everybody's world up suddenly and big time

427
01:01:52.790 --> 01:02:00.710
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: by everybody. I assume you mean Americans, I mean, I think everybody was like, Oh, gosh! You can weaponize aircraft! Yes. Well.

428
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:01.050
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: couldn't.

429
01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:01.540
Jerry Michalski: It was.

430
01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.379
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Americans big time.

431
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:08.760
Jerry Michalski: It was a symbolic act against Americans with a very narrow geographic focus. I mean, it was like.

432
01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:18.469
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But it changed, but it changed air travel around the world. So everybody had that there certainly in the you know, in the jihadist community. It had a profound effect as well.

433
01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.280
Scott Moehring: It started to tip up. Actually, in 1995.

434
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.470
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Oh, okay.

435
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:26.360
Scott Moehring: And then it it did.

436
01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.640
Scott Moehring: But it it is an interesting thing I highly recommend just.

437
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.949
Jerry Michalski: If you can add the the link to that engram. Yeah, perfect. Thank you. Perfect.

438
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:44.720
Scott Moehring: Yeah. And then I'll just do just as a counterpoint. I'll do agency. And it was just something that I realized, because, as I've talked

439
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:56.069
Scott Moehring: shared some of the things that I've been thinking about over the years here. My focus has been on the individual because I feel like it's something I actually can

440
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.480
Scott Moehring: have some effect over.

441
01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.820
Scott Moehring: And I think you know, if you tell 2 friends, and they tell 2 friends, and

442
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:08.000
Scott Moehring: so on. You end up with an effect that

443
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:13.629
Scott Moehring: at least you might be able to see locally or within your local group. So that's enough for me.

444
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.310
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Scott. Stacey.

445
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:29.619
Stacey Druss: Yeah, thank you, Scott. I just want to add about that about 9 11, the piece of it where it served as a wake up call for so many people, because I had so many friends that

446
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.350
Stacey Druss: shifted their focus from what success meant.

447
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:48.989
Stacey Druss: and driving into the city and like their careers, and they just changed their lives around to be simpler. They develop their relationships with family and friends got closer. So I just don't. I want to include that piece of

448
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:53.690
Stacey Druss: a tragedy as well, and coming back from it.

449
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:02.370
Jerry Michalski: One of

450
01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:17.830
Jerry Michalski: just going back to 9 11. I remember feeling like the day after 9 11. There were articles about how people on the New York subway system were looking at each other differently, about how there was a certain tenderness and vulnerability in the air

451
01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:23.629
Jerry Michalski: which was sad but magical, but different

452
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:34.980
Jerry Michalski: somehow, because New Yorkers tend to be brusk. And it's like, Yeah, we we, you know, they walk past each other trying sort of to maintain their own bubble and not get involved in whatever whatever

453
01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:40.769
Jerry Michalski: and I was hoping that George W. Bush's message to the nation

454
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.200
Jerry Michalski: was going to be. Hey, New Yorkers.

455
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:48.740
Jerry Michalski: that feeling you've been having when you see each other on the street, or sit on the subway

456
01:04:49.231 --> 01:04:53.299
Jerry Michalski: can you help us all understand what it is? And can we tap into that?

457
01:04:53.460 --> 01:05:00.669
Jerry Michalski: And can we take that somewhere positive to figure out, to, to go into? And through this experience of grief

458
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:27.979
Jerry Michalski: together, and I think that might have been an opening door that was positive, and instead his message was go shopping famously, famously, he said, go shopping. If the economy falters, we're all in trouble, so don't worry. Shopping malls are safe. Just go spend money like you always do, and everything will be okay. And I hated that. And, by the way, separate short story bush Senior was on duty when the Berlin wall falls.

459
01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:42.950
Jerry Michalski: And there's this magical moment when the Berlin wall falls. That's very similar. It's a pivotal moment in Western human history. Everybody's sort of looking at that going. Oh, my God! This this artifact that has been dividing the world for years and years is now melted.

460
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:52.329
Jerry Michalski: We could have done something very similar at that moment, and processed sort of grief and expectations and other sorts of things together, and and we didn't.

461
01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.279
Jerry Michalski: So I think that

462
01:05:55.020 --> 01:06:08.700
Jerry Michalski: never waste a good crisis is a horrible thing to say right now. But we have wasted these moments of crisis and change in ways that have not helped civilization, and they've kind of managed to divide us more.

463
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:13.370
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: What did Bush senior say at that time? You're going to say something about that.

464
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:20.689
Jerry Michalski: I don't have a quote for Bush Senior at the time. I just know that there there was a leadership moment that he just missed.

465
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:21.200
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

466
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.479
Jerry Michalski: And he he! You know he was busy trying to figure out. Oh.

467
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:40.360
Jerry Michalski: the power dynamics have now shifted! How do we get whatever intelligence is available. How do we rearrange our partnerships and our strategic alliances? All those kinds of things would have been probably primary, but for me there was a in these in these major

468
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:59.970
Jerry Michalski: surprising incidents, although I won't say unexpected, because 9, 11, some people were shouting at us. This is going to happen like they're not not completely unexpected, but certainly in black swanish, right? But in these moments there's there's really seeds for large scale mental shifts that were not

469
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.490
Jerry Michalski: taking advantage of

470
01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:08.879
Jerry Michalski: bad phrase that we're not making use of. I'm not sure exactly how to say this nicely.

471
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:24.199
Jerry Michalski: and I have a feeling that more enlightened leadership would be able to shift our perspectives more rapidly toward healthier ways of seeing. And Stacy. I think one of the things that's happened about men's behavior is.

472
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:44.479
Jerry Michalski: we've lost notions of men as guardians or stewards. And now masculinity, as you can see from the Mega male kind of stereotypes and the manosphere, and all of that has gone like off the rails in some other complete direction. And there's a lot of young men who don't have role models and don't know what to do in.

473
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:54.479
Jerry Michalski: There's a system built to catch them and groom them in, I think, relatively dysfunctional notions of what it means to be a man in the world.

474
01:07:54.590 --> 01:08:00.609
Jerry Michalski: And then we wonder when you know when all these other things kind of spike up later on. Stop, please.

475
01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:13.949
Scott Moehring: I think this. I wasn't sure this was going to apply to this topic. I was at a funeral over the weekend. Well, yeah, over the weekend.

476
01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:22.467
Scott Moehring: and that's a very individual personal thing, but it's also common across all of us.

477
01:08:23.406 --> 01:08:29.480
Scott Moehring: And what was fascinating to me was all the conversations beforehand about

478
01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:34.119
Scott Moehring: some of these dynamics that were behind the scene.

479
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:42.080
Scott Moehring: Oh, this person broke up with this person, and I'm not going to talk to them because they spurned them, and etc. Etc.

480
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:50.060
Scott Moehring: And being confronted with the finality of everything and seeing it, you know our own.

481
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:54.429
Scott Moehring: you know ultimately our own destiny. It kind of.

482
01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:55.310
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: It.

483
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:58.340
Scott Moehring: Changed them, and they all

484
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:07.669
Scott Moehring: purposely went out and found each other, and had the conversations, brief as they were at the funeral, to

485
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.849
Scott Moehring: smooth it over and say, You know what

486
01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:15.290
Scott Moehring: life's too short. I don't want to hold a grudge against you anymore.

487
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:19.229
Scott Moehring: And it was really it was really remarkable to see

488
01:09:19.763 --> 01:09:29.930
Scott Moehring: because again, on an individual level, it happened. And how do you build that into a more collective, societal thing, where we realize that

489
01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:37.160
Scott Moehring: it's us. It's all us. It's always us. It's not us and them right.

490
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:40.390
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

491
01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:50.219
Jerry Michalski: Let's sit in silence for a little bit with this, and see where we go for the last little stretch of our call.

492
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:52.089
Jerry Michalski: I'll bring us back up.

493
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.440
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: You know, you know.

494
01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.170
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Thank you. Well, I've been here

495
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.290
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: absolutely.

496
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:54.659
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, and quoting, Oh, sorry, Stacey, go ahead.

497
01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:09.019
Stacey Druss: Just real quick. I just want to encourage the use of the word grooming that you just used when speaking about young Maga boys. I think we should speak about them in terms of being groomed

498
01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:12.490
Stacey Druss: for a couple of reasons. I just think that's a perfect word.

499
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.949
Jerry Michalski: If you look at the system, that's kind of been set up and how well, it has worked

500
01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:23.020
Jerry Michalski: it fits the word fits reasonably well.

501
01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:31.369
Stacey Druss: Well, the other nice piece of it, because you mentioned forgiveness is that it can help to see

502
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:37.299
Stacey Druss: the victimization of them as well, and could aid in the forgiveness piece.

503
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:40.939
Jerry Michalski: Nicely put. Thank you.

504
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:44.870
Jerry Michalski: Hank. I was just gonna check in with you and ask you where your heart is on this.

505
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:50.316
Hank Kune: Well, I I missed

506
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:55.909
Hank Kune: last week's call, which was more about personal grief.

507
01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:07.689
Hank Kune: So I I'm thinking now there's a very strong connection in me between personal grief and societal grief.

508
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:14.939
Hank Kune: In the period between trump getting elected

509
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:18.870
Hank Kune: and the 1st month or 2 of his.

510
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:24.770
Hank Kune: of his reign as empire of idiocy in America.

511
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:33.300
Hank Kune: I felt that my own youth and my own innocence

512
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:42.739
Hank Kune: was being ripped away from me. My feeling that I have had a

513
01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.860
Hank Kune: for give and take most of my 77 years.

514
01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:54.179
Hank Kune: that people are generally good, and governments too, and

515
01:12:55.180 --> 01:13:00.410
Hank Kune: if left to their own devices, they'll tend to do the right thing.

516
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:09.610
Hank Kune: and I know intellectually that history shows many examples of when that isn't true.

517
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:16.620
Hank Kune: But I also know that history does show examples of when it, when it is true.

518
01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:23.380
Hank Kune: So moving my own loss and my grieving

519
01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.039
Hank Kune: through the 5 stages of the Kubler-ross model.

520
01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:39.929
Hank Kune: it took me about 4 months to reach acceptance and thinking about what acceptance might mean.

521
01:13:40.823 --> 01:13:44.670
Hank Kune: For me and for people like us

522
01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:51.590
Hank Kune: who probably can't change the cycle that we're in

523
01:13:52.090 --> 01:14:03.610
Hank Kune: these things happen in cycles, and we seem to be in a cycle moving towards towards

524
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.869
Hank Kune: add things in society. But maybe we can.

525
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.340
Hank Kune: by accepting that it's going to happen, perhaps shift

526
01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:18.940
Hank Kune: some of the consequences, because the consequences haven't happened yet.

527
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:23.499
Hank Kune: They happen day by day the futures

528
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.350
Hank Kune: appear and unfold day by day.

529
01:14:27.691 --> 01:14:32.940
Hank Kune: So I was wondering during the 1st parts of this call

530
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.700
Hank Kune: are those 5 stages of of Kubleros?

531
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.149
Hank Kune: Are they true for societies as well?

532
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.520
Hank Kune: And if they're true for societies as well.

533
01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:49.810
Hank Kune: what happens in societies after acceptance?

534
01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:57.940
Hank Kune: What those acceptance of bad things.

535
01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:06.949
Hank Kune: of walking away from people in need of help from looking away at what's happening with climate and

536
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:11.239
Hank Kune: and all the evils done to women and

537
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:20.780
Hank Kune: black lives which don't end up to matter for most white people, and

538
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:26.000
Hank Kune: that forms a kind of inner climate of society.

539
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:36.280
Hank Kune: But can that inner climate of society be shaped or shifted by people

540
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.009
Hank Kune: like us, by a small group of people who feel that it's important

541
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:47.259
Hank Kune: to accept what's happening. But change, what's going to happen?

542
01:15:47.800 --> 01:16:00.630
Hank Kune: Don't know if I've really made myself clear on that. And I I put this into the chat as well. And it's a question I have. I don't have an answer. But what did the Japanese do after Hiroshima and Nagasaki

543
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.219
Hank Kune: far bigger shock than 9 11.

544
01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:07.640
Hank Kune: So that's where I'm at at the moment.

545
01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.059
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Hank, thank you very much.

546
01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:19.580
Jerry Michalski: I have a tiny bit of perspective on how Japan responded to this, which is and which ought to be fact checked.

547
01:16:20.605 --> 01:16:26.139
Jerry Michalski: Japan apparently does not teach Japan's role in World War 2 to students

548
01:16:26.825 --> 01:16:35.949
Jerry Michalski: Japan does not have Stoicbach Steina, or museums dedicated, I mean, there's the Hiroshima monument of Hey, look! We were devastated by a bomb, but

549
01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:49.449
Jerry Michalski: but they don't. They did not engage in war guilt. Other other kinds of things. The responses of Japan and Germany, I think, are maybe this is the wrong way to set it this way almost diametrically opposite

550
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:53.310
Jerry Michalski: to their role in World War 2. And what to do about it?

551
01:16:55.140 --> 01:17:01.339
Jerry Michalski: Both countries were demilitarized as much as possible. And right now.

552
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:26.000
Jerry Michalski: because of China's possible violence against Taiwan because of a bunch of different things, and certainly because of the war in Ukraine. Right now, we're seeing the remilitarization of both countries. In particular, Germany is jumping right in because somebody's got to lead and help Ukraine, etc. Etc. And and also the belief that you know, after Ukraine or Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, etc. Etc.

553
01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:32.623
Jerry Michalski: Th, this could go for quite a while if if it's allowed to keep going anyway. So

554
01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:40.359
Jerry Michalski: again, I come back to? What are the best ways? What are the most useful ways to process

555
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:46.609
Jerry Michalski: hugely difficult experiences at a collective level?

556
01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.750
Jerry Michalski: What do you ask people to do? What do you make people do?

557
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:54.539
Jerry Michalski: How do you frame? How do you frame those moments?

558
01:17:55.730 --> 01:18:05.377
Jerry Michalski: And if, if after this call, if any of you bump into essays thoughts whatever. Put them on the list share them back in because we've got

559
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:09.830
Jerry Michalski: This might show up later. Stacey.

560
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:18.370
Stacey Druss: You're you're reminding me of restorative justice where the criminal needs to listen

561
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:22.839
Stacey Druss: to what? To the words of the people that they've heard

562
01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:27.269
Stacey Druss: Klaus mentioned how the Allies forced

563
01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:29.869
Stacey Druss: those visions to be on TV.

564
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:32.560
Stacey Druss: You know, people don't want to look

565
01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.840
Stacey Druss: the bad stuff, the ugly stuff or their own behavior.

566
01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:45.850
Stacey Druss: So I think there's something in it to have to listen to these stories.

567
01:18:46.836 --> 01:18:55.270
Stacey Druss: Maybe in the safety of a group where nobody's being singled out. But that's so important. And that's why it's just so egregious

568
01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:00.590
Stacey Druss: at what schools are. You know what they're trying to do to schools and take away all these stories

569
01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:01.890
Stacey Druss: over.

570
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:16.439
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Stacey. Restorative justice and truth and reconciliation are in my brain under many different categories, but they're under design from trust, which is the thing I've been chewing on for a couple of decades now, and the idea that

571
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:31.940
Jerry Michalski: truth and reconciliation is you tell us the truth. You confess to the thing that you did, and we have a different sense of justice and balance, and and in exchange for the truth as best we can figure it out

572
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:54.460
Jerry Michalski: that's valuable to society, and will help us heal, etc, etc. And I think, like truth and reconciliation in Argentina. I think, work pretty well. I think that's you know Gil is asking in the chat. Where do we think there have been successes? I think there are successes. I think there's some places where post-conflict good things happened. There are some places I would love to know more about, like Moorish Spain.

573
01:19:54.750 --> 01:20:05.450
Jerry Michalski: You know the the Caliphate in Spain that came in from Africa and basically took over Africa for a couple 100 years, and then got kicked out by the Catholics and the Berbers from the South

574
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:08.240
Jerry Michalski: there was tremendous

575
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:19.680
Jerry Michalski: cooperation and academic work and poetry in, you know more Spain, and there's a there's a large Spanish city called Matamoros.

576
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:26.099
Jerry Michalski: and if you decompose it. It means kill the Moors. The name of the city is Kill Moors.

577
01:20:28.117 --> 01:20:29.829
Jerry Michalski: Moors being those Arabs

578
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.729
Jerry Michalski: 1,500 years. Gosh! I forgot it was that it was that long sorry about that. Thanks, Ken.

579
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:50.249
Jerry Michalski: But for me, I would love to know more about what worked really well in more Spain. I'm very interested in historic periods where there was convivencia. This whole idea of hey? We don't care. I just read, and I'll post a guest essay. A friend has a

580
01:20:50.460 --> 01:21:09.840
Jerry Michalski: a substack called jigsaw puzzle, global jigsaw. It's called, and she's really smart, and she has a couple of people write guest posts, and one was just posted about India, and it was a real cultural sort of peek into how India has so many languages, so many cultures, and yet seems to sort of muddle through and get along.

581
01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:29.350
Jerry Michalski: Not that there hasn't been violence, that there's been like large scale violence, but it was a really nice look into collaboration, and also there was another post about the Jewish silk road. Let me find those and post them to the chat before I forget them. But go ahead, Gil.

582
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:33.836
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

583
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:41.059
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: designed from trust, Jerry. Thanks for raising that. It's also designed for the possibility of trust, isn't it?

584
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:53.280
Jerry Michalski: Yes, that's in fact, what it? Yeah, that's what it's that's what it's meant. That's what it's meant to do. It's not foisting trust forcing people to trust. It's like, hey? If you did this you might trust each other more.

585
01:21:53.660 --> 01:22:04.450
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And the example that's in my mind lately we may have mentioned, this last week is around medical malpractice hospital systems that have given agency to their doctors rather than their attorneys

586
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:08.029
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: have found that when the doctors apologize

587
01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:17.319
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: for bad stuff that happens, sometimes apologize to the families, medical malpractice suits plummet.

588
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:28.820
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: People recognize that. You know this is imperfect. Mistakes happen, they appreciate the consideration, and they grieve, they grieve and they forgive, and they don't sue.

589
01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:29.650
Jerry Michalski: Hmm.

590
01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:36.049
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: When there's a direct communication and apology rather than lawyers, saying, Oh, no, you can't save that.

591
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:41.140
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And we all have little lawyers insides our heads, don't we?

592
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.660
Jerry Michalski: Apparently they were installed early.

593
01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:44.250
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

594
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.450
Scott Moehring: You do? Do you think that that relates to

595
01:22:53.570 --> 01:23:00.230
Scott Moehring: troll behavior online, where people are able to? There say things online that they wouldn't say to people's faces.

596
01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:01.050
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Sure.

597
01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:05.109
Scott Moehring: And then in the same way, yeah, so-, so that if you get the 2.

598
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.009
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Distant and anonymous.

599
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:10.870
Scott Moehring: So if you get the 2 people together

600
01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:20.640
Scott Moehring: apologizing or or saying what they need to say, instead of intermediaries who have their own agendas.

601
01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:20.960
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah.

602
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:22.280
Scott Moehring: Interesting. Okay.

603
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:37.799
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, or actually listening to each other and inquiring about what each other cares about. And maybe it needs to be helped and facilitated by people who are skillful at that, because we don't all know how to do that. But you know, in my few experiences of reaching across the gulf

604
01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.769
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: around that sort of thing. I find remarkable openings.

605
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:53.962
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and I find also I don't not a lot on the Internet, because I curate my followers pretty tightly, but I had somebody yesterday who I've had some reasonable conversations with

606
01:23:54.670 --> 01:24:05.969
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and something came up around around Israel and Gaza, and instead of having a discussion about where we disagree or have different interpretations. He just started yelling at me like, you're complicit.

607
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:12.250
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I thought interesting, like, you know you, you've seen like 5% of my posts. You've never talked with me.

608
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.840
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You don't know the conversation that I have in my life with real people.

609
01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.330
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: but it's easy for you to like, you know. Throw, throw an aspersion at me.

610
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:27.360
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: and I haven't responded. I'm kind of wondering how to respond in a ways productive, and I think I'm going to ask, you know, like.

611
01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:33.129
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: what's what's your objective in your communication with me? Are you trying to change my mind?

612
01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:44.190
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Are you trying to? You're certainly not trying to design from trust. But like, what are you looking for here? Because just calling names doesn't advance anything that you, this other person actually care about.

613
01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.659
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So like, what's up.

614
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:59.830
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But yeah, I think I think the there's the anonymity of it. There's some interesting stuff I've seen in the last few days. I'll see if I can find the links to it. Talking about the breakdown in human communication in the age of the Internet.

615
01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:04.155
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I've seen it very directly in, and

616
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:11.969
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I think particularly younger people, but I'm told it's more broad of people who are not curious. They don't know how to ask questions or have conversations.

617
01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:20.345
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: There's a a i gotta find this. Maybe this in the Times the last few days about

618
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:27.920
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: People younger than us, having less and less social life, because so much of their life is mediated through the electrons.

619
01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:36.180
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And so, being with people in relationships of depth, seems to, according to some people seems to be weakening. Don't know.

620
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:43.449
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It's certainly, I think not what we expected when when

621
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:46.620
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: these things suddenly appeared in our lives.

622
01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.240
Jerry Michalski: That's right, and I still don't have my flying car.

623
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.740
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: No coming.

624
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.680
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Or my jetpack.

625
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.440
Jerry Michalski: Yeah. Yeah.

626
01:25:57.270 --> 01:26:03.165
Jerry Michalski: Although when you see people on jet packs, you're like, I'm not so sure I'd be up for doing that.

627
01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.759
Jerry Michalski: When John Robinson was doing it, though

628
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.189
Jerry Michalski: both trips end fast and sharp.

629
01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:19.049
Jerry Michalski: Any concluding thoughts. We're near at the end of our time. Any, I take it, we might be

630
01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:28.129
Jerry Michalski: tuckered out on this topic. I think that we've raised a couple of interesting questions that might make future topics. But any any concluding thoughts.

631
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.049
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: It's it's

632
01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:38.049
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: it's a tough and deep topic, Jerry. It's like, you know, it's not something we can resolve quickly. It opens, it opens things, and then ripples go deep, and we might want to revisit it.

633
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:43.170
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: you know, in 2 or 3 or 6 months, or something, or whenever it comes up.

634
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:46.639
Jerry Michalski: Cool. I thought I heard Ken's voice.

635
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:47.610
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Thank you.

636
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.166
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I've been

637
01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:57.009
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: trying to find something that crystallized that I could say. It's been difficult, because it's been a very fast conversation. Actually

638
01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.909
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I would have liked more stillness.

639
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:06.799
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I'll just tell a story that Jack Cornfield used to tell about at the end of the Vietnam war. This very famous

640
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:20.039
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Buddhist monk who was going to do a healing ceremony, and there were tens of thousands of people who'd been displaced and lost family members, and who were wounded and maimed, and they were all gathered. And they're like, What's this guy going to do?

641
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:24.070
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And he came out and he began to chant.

642
01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:39.789
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: It's an old Buddhist chant says hatred never ceases from hatred, but by love alone is healed. This is an ancient and eternal law, and he just kept chanting that over and over and over, and pretty soon everybody in the place was weeping because they realized they had so much hate.

643
01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:51.732
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: they had so much anger. They had so much rage at what had occurred, and in listening to this, to realize that that's not going to do anything except make it worse.

644
01:27:52.720 --> 01:28:02.260
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: It reminds me of James Baldwin's quote that you know the reason most people hang on to their hatred, so so closely is they realize once they once they let go of them, they'll have to deal with their pain.

645
01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:17.440
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And I think people in general in our culture weird cultures are very pain, averse. They don't want to look at their pain. They don't want to look at what's underneath. They just want to distract themselves, you know. Give me

646
01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:33.849
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: give me a movie. Give me? Give me drugs. Give me alcohol, whatever it is. You know I just don't want to go there, and I know that's been true for me personally in many areas of my life where you know, I wouldn't look at the pain until it caught up and grabbed me by the throat and said, You need to look at this

647
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:47.370
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: particularly. We talked about young men. You know. Young men are not trained in how to handle this. I never got any lessons on how to handle the grief of losing my mother, who, I didn't know, was sick, or, you know it took me 25 years

648
01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:50.480
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: to practice to to deal with that.

649
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.219
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: You know, and

650
01:28:53.820 --> 01:29:03.079
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I'm lucky I found a way, you know. I got help, but help is not generally available for that. That's Gil asked earlier. You know, what are we cultivating

651
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:04.910
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: as a culture?

652
01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:10.520
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: We tend to cultivate things that do not increased separateness.

653
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:15.930
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: the increased disconnection that increase, atomization, increase dehumanization.

654
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:23.929
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And years ago I read somebody quoting that said that, strictly speaking, there are no warlike people, but there are warlike leaders

655
01:29:24.170 --> 01:29:31.240
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and warlike leaders as we're seeing right now. Cultivate hatred, they cultivate separation, they cultivate demonization.

656
01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.290
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And we know where that goes. We saw that 80 years ago we saw that

657
01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:48.349
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: ordinary people will press buttons that will drop atomic bombs, and they'll put people in ovens under the right circumstances. Everyone is subject to that, me included. I'm not exempt from that. None of us on this call are.

658
01:29:48.710 --> 01:29:52.680
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and recognizing that, and being willing to look at

659
01:29:52.990 --> 01:30:10.589
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: having the abyss in your soul stare back at you with all of the darkness, with all of the ancient hatreds that have belonged to humanity. For as long as humanity has been on the planet, and know that under the right circumstances it can take you over, and therefore you need to be very vigilant and very willing to look at yourself

660
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:16.099
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and say, if that comes along, I would sooner die than act on those impulses.

661
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:22.230
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: That's a maturation process that we could cultivate the fact that

662
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:28.829
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: quote, modern peoples no longer initiate their children into the wonders of being alive.

663
01:30:29.358 --> 01:30:31.569
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: You know there is no connection

664
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:34.249
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: for most people to the earth.

665
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:50.819
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: We talk about nature as if it was something separate from us. Rather, you know, Vanessa Andreati says that humans are an extension of Gaia's body, not the other way around. That's an incredibly different stance to hold.

666
01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:00.329
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and when you have that, then you start to weep and and mourn for what has been lost of Gaia's body of the cloak of life that's being unraveled.

667
01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.100
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And when it comes to warriorship

668
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:10.990
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: which is not about fighting a war, but rather about how you are in the world filled with

669
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.750
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: different battles.

670
01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:26.859
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: The saying that I really like is in conflict. You don't bring a knife that cuts you. Bring a needle that sews. So what do we do? How do we bring that needle in and sew up what is unraveling, and reweave what is unraveling

671
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.519
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and grief has a really big part in that, because it's

672
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:33.000
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: I mentioned last week about the tiers.

673
01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:38.740
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Certain kinds of tears prevent you from being ripped apart when large, painful things are moving through you.

674
01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:46.310
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: We've got really big, large, painful things as societies to to atone for, to amend, make amends for.

675
01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:53.340
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and it's not going to happen from individuals going through it alone. It's going to happen, from people coming together and saying, we got to face this

676
01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:58.060
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and that which we don't learn through through comedy. We learn through tragedy.

677
01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:03.190
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: you know, looking at all the disasters occurring sooner or later. People are going to recognize, you know what

678
01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:07.990
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: there's no them. There's only us, and we need each other. If we're going to get through this.

679
01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:14.130
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and that'll be a different kind of grief, and that'll be the kind of grief that takes us out the other side into some kind of joy.

680
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:19.000
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: But there'll be tremendous grieving for what's been lost along the way, and that will never be replaced.

681
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:22.460
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So those are some of my thoughts on

682
01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:28.369
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: societal or social, or larger scales of grief than just dealing with your own individual pain.

683
01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:36.049
Jerry Michalski: But if you can, ken, did you want to jump in for a moment before we wrap up.

684
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.920
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Hey!

685
01:32:44.610 --> 01:32:48.569
Hank Kune: Yeah, but it's hard to say anything after.

686
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.280
Jerry Michalski: Yeah.

687
01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.669
Hank Kune: Beautiful words of Ken

688
01:32:52.430 --> 01:33:01.299
Hank Kune: I. You had asked the question, would we want to come back to this topic after a couple of months, and I was going to say, especially if people

689
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:09.920
Hank Kune: can bring examples of how individuals, communities, and countries are able to

690
01:33:10.770 --> 01:33:14.640
Hank Kune: deal with their grief and change their inner climate.

691
01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:20.190
Jerry Michalski: Agreed. I like that. Thank you, Stacey.

692
01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:25.900
Stacey Druss: Yeah. I just wanna say real quickly that on my call on Monday, this coming up

693
01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:38.230
Stacey Druss: at one o'clock Eastern time. I'd like to pick up from what Ken was saying, and maybe maybe bring that needle and focus on the young

694
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:48.579
Stacey Druss: type, boys or whatever. So I hope that some of you will be able to come because I'd really like to have your input. But I want to continue this conversation.

695
01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:57.060
Jerry Michalski: Cool ken. Hast thou a poem.

696
01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:01.490
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: It's not a poem, but I thought I would read a few excerpts.

697
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:07.780
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: not the whole thing, because it's very long. A few excerpts from Chief Seattle's speech. Is everybody familiar with Chief Seattle's speech? Anybody

698
01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.479
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: not heard of this before?

699
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.120
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: There are a couple different versions, but

700
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:25.580
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: just a few things I copied out. I do not know. Our ways are different from your ways. The sight of your cities pains the eyes of the red man, but perhaps it is because the red man is a savage and does not understand.

701
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:38.679
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: There is no quiet place in the white man cities, no place to hear the unfurling of the leaves in spring, or the rustle of the insect's wings. But perhaps it is because I am a savage, and I do not understand.

702
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:42.090
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: The clatter only seems to insult the ears.

703
01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:50.519
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: And what is there to life if a man cannot hear the only cry of the whippoorwill, or the arguments of the frogs around a pond at night

704
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:54.090
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: am a red man, and I do not understand.

705
01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:10.019
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: The Indian prefers the soft sound of the wind darting over the face of a pond, and the smell of the wind itself cleansed by a midday rain or scented with pinion pine. The air is precious to the red man, for all things share the same breath.

706
01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:16.479
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: The beast, the tree, the man. They all share the same breath.

707
01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:23.579
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: The white man does not seem to notice the air he breathes like a man dying for many days. He is numb to the stench.

708
01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:33.119
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: but if we sell our land, you must remember that the air is precious to us that the air shears its spirit with all the life it supports.

709
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:39.200
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: The wind that gave our grandfather his 1st breath, also receives his last sigh.

710
01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:51.529
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and the wind must also give our children the spirit of life, and if we sell our land you must keep it apart and sacred as a place where even the white man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow's flowers.

711
01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:57.810
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: To us the ashes our ancestors are sacred, and their resting place is hollowed ground.

712
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.050
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: You wander far from the graves of your ancestors, and seemingly without regret.

713
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:09.009
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Your religion was written upon tablets of stone by the iron finger of your God, so you could not forget.

714
01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:21.000
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: The red man could never comprehend or remember it. Our religion is the traditions of our ancestors, the dreams of our elders, given to them in solemn hours of the night by the Great Spirit

715
01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:24.839
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: and the visions of our sachems, and it is written in the hearts of our people.

716
01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:37.859
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: your dead cease to love you and the land as soon as their nativity and the land of their nativity, as soon as they pass the portals of the tomb and wander away beyond the stars. They are soon forgotten and never return

717
01:36:38.230 --> 01:36:41.539
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: are dead. Never forget this beautiful world that gave them being.

718
01:36:41.780 --> 01:37:01.639
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: They still love its verdant valleys, its murmuring rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered vales, and verdant lined lakes and bays, and ever yearn in tender, fond affection over the lonely hearted living, and often return from the happy hunting ground to visit, guide, console, and comfort them.

719
01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:23.800
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: We will ponder your proposition, and when we decide we will let you know. But should we accept it, I here and now make this condition, that we will not be denied the privilege without molestation, of visiting at any time the tombs of our ancestors, friends, and children. Every part of this soil is sacred in the estimation of my people. Every hillside, every valley.

720
01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:52.660
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: every plain, every grove, has been hallowed by some sad or happy event, in days long vanished. Even the rocks, which seem dumb and dead as the swelter in the sun along the science shore thrill with memories of stirring events connected to the lives of my people, and the very dust upon which you now stand responds more lovingly to their footsteps than to yours, because it is rich with the blood of our ancestors, and our bare feet are conscious of the sympathetic touch.

721
01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:59.890
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: What is a man without the beasts? If all the beasts are gone, men would die from a great loneliness of spirit.

722
01:38:00.210 --> 01:38:05.100
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Whatever happens to the beast soon happens to man, all things are connected.

723
01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:15.540
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Let him be just, and deal kindly with my people, for the dead are not powerless. Dead. Did I say there is no death, there is only a change of worlds.

724
01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:21.010
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

725
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:24.750
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: Thank you all.

726
01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.099
Jerry Michalski: Or showing up the way you have.

727
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:33.800
Jerry Michalski: This is beautiful and intense.

728
01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:47.309
Jerry Michalski: Off we go into another, into another weekend almost, and August, and the rest of our lives.

729
01:38:48.610 --> 01:38:49.560
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

730
01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.400
Ken Homer • SF Bay Area: So.
