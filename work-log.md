# Work Log - Multi-Call Wiki Project

This file tracks progress across all sessions. Each session should add an entry with date, what was accomplished, tokens used, and what's next.

---

## Session 1 - 2025-11-16

   - Added detailed implementation for all phases
   - Documented artifact structures (JSON, CSV, MD formats)
   - Specified batch processing patterns
   - Created token budget comparison table
   - Added complete resumability guidelines
3. ✅ Incorporated token-aware workflow into Instructions document
   - Added "Token Management: CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS" section
   - Updated Phase 1 with batch processing guidance

5. ✅ Committed changes to git (3 commits)
   - bf7cf48 "Complete and incorporate token-aware workflow design"
   - 7c95081 "Add tracking files for token-aware workflow"
   - [pending] "Begin Phase 0: Create call inventory and artifacts directory"
6. ✅ Explored repository structure
   - Discovered 16 calls (not 15)
   - Identified 3 call types: Hybrid, Check-in, Topical
   - Mapped file structure (VTT transcripts, chat logs, AI summaries)
7. ✅ Started Phase 0: Multi-Call Mapping
   - Created _artifacts/ directory
   - Created call-inventory.csv (complete)
   - Created phase-0-summary.md (initial documentation)

### Tokens Used
- Session total: ~57K tokens
- Reading initial files: ~30K
- Completing proposal and instructions: ~16K
- Creating tracking files and Phase 0 work: ~11K

### Current State
- **Branch**: claude/token-aware-workflow-01Y9h2r2b2VrDjeczZBW6FNd
- **Files created/modified**:
  - Proposal for Token-Aware Workflow Design.md (completed - 535 lines)
  - Instructions for AI Assistant - Handling Many Calls Together.md (updated with token mgmt)
  - work-log.md (this file)
  - detailed-todo-list.md (comprehensive breakdown)
  - _artifacts/call-inventory.csv (16 calls documented)
  - _artifacts/phase-0-summary.md (mapping summary)
- **Phase 0 progress**: Inventory complete, still need participant matrix and topic clustering
- **Calls discovered**: 16 total (July 31 - Nov 13, 2025)
  - 11 Hybrid calls
  - 3 Check-in calls
  - 3 Topical calls (Collaboration, Abundance, Crony Capitalism)

### Key Discoveries
- Repository contains 16 calls, not 15 as initially expected
- Last call (Nov 13) split into 2 parts
- Each call has: VTT transcript, chat log, AI-generated summary PDF
- Call series: Open Global Mind (OGM)
- Date range: 2025-07-31 through 2025-11-13 (3.5 months, mostly weekly)

### Next Steps for Session 2
1. Complete Phase 0 remaining tasks:
   - Create participant-attendance.csv (scan transcripts for names)
   - Create topic-clusters.json (initial topic mapping)
   - Document check-in analysis
   - Commit complete Phase 0 artifacts
2. Adjust batch planning for 16 calls instead of 15
3. Begin Phase 1 Batch 1 (Calls 01-03)

### Notes
- Token management approach working well - minimal tokens for Phase 0 mapping
- Structured artifacts (CSV, MD) enable low-token tracking
- Ready to resume at any point with clear documentation
- Next session can pick up exactly where this left off

- Check-in calls (02, 06) provide different participation patterns than topical calls
- Token-aware workflow working perfectly - structured artifacts keep token usage low
- Running artifacts (topics, participants JSON) will compound value as more batches added
- Ready to process remaining 13 calls in 5 more batches

## Session 4 - 2025-11-16 (Continuing from Session 3)

### Objective
Complete all remaining batches (4, 5, 6) - process Calls 10-16

### Accomplished (In Progress)
1. ✅ Completed Batch 3 (Calls 07-09)
   - Created call-07-data.json (Collaboration vs Teamwork - Scott Moehring's framework)
   - Created call-08-data.json (Abundance speed round - 15+ definitions)
   - Created call-09-data.json (OGM meta-discussion - growth, platforms, identity)
   - Created batch-03-summary.md (comprehensive synthesis)
   - Updated running-topics.json with Batch 3 themes
   - Committed Batch 3 (commit 479615f)
2. ✅ Started Batch 4 (Calls 10-12)
   - Created call-10-data.json (AI as conversation participant - John Warinner epiphany)
   - Committed Call 10 (commit f7781ca)
   - **Kevin Jones RETURNED** after being absent Calls 07-09!
3. 🔄 In progress: Calls 11-12

### Tokens Used
- Session 4 total so far: ~40K tokens (cumulative: ~152K of 200K)
- Batch 3 completion: ~15K tokens
- Call 10 extraction: ~14K tokens
- Efficient pace for remaining work

### Current State
- **Branch**: claude/token-aware-workflow-01Y9h2r2b2VrDjeczZBW6FNd
- **Completed**: Batches 1-3 (Calls 01-09)
- **In Progress**: Batch 4 (Call 10 done, Calls 11-12 remaining)
- **Remaining**: Batch 5 (Calls 13-15), Batch 6 (Call 16)
- **Token Budget**: 88K remaining - sustainable for 6 remaining calls

### Key Discoveries in Session 4
- **Batch 3 pattern**: All three calls about defining things (collaboration, abundance, OGM itself)
- **Definition methods identified**: Extended dialogue (Call 07), speed round (Call 08), meta-discussion (Call 09)
- **Call 10 breakthrough**: John Warinner's epiphany - why one-on-ones with ChatGPT when LLMs could participate in group conversations?
- **Kevin Jones return**: Absent Batch 3 (Calls 07-09), returned Call 10 with minimal participation, Call 11 has AMAZING news (Mennonite carpenters rebuilding Swannanoa for free!)
- **OGM identity tension continues**: Jerry frustrated - "I'd really like to build a global mind... We haven't done much of that at all"
- **Practical AI tools emerging**: Shawn Murphy's Thinkertoys, Stacey's podcast generation, Jerry's focus group app

### Next Steps for Session 5 (or continuation)
1. Complete Batch 4:
   - Extract Call 11 data (worldview challenges, Kevin's Mennonite news)
   - Extract Call 12 data (Crony Capitalism topical call)
   - Create batch-04-summary.md
   - Update running artifacts
   - Commit Batch 4
2. Process Batch 5 (Calls 13-15)
3. Process Batch 6 (Call 16)
4. Final synthesis and commit

### Notes
- Token-aware workflow continues to work excellently
- Batch 3 revealed definition obsession pattern across multiple calls
- Kevin Jones story arc: Deteriorating (Calls 01-02) → Finding role (Call 06) → Absent (Calls 07-09) → Returned with minimal participation (Call 10) → AMAZING NEWS (Call 11 - Mennonites!)
- Call 10 perfectly illustrates the work I'm doing: extracting value from long conversations
- On track to complete all 16 calls within token budget
