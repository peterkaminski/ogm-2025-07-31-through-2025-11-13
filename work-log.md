# Work Log - Multi-Call Wiki Project

This file tracks progress across all sessions. Each session should add an entry with date, what was accomplished, tokens used, and what's next.

## Session 1 - 2025-11-16

### Objective
Set up token-aware workflow and prepare to process multiple calls into unified wiki.

### Accomplished
1. ✅ Read and analyzed existing instructions and proposal documents
2. ✅ Completed the Token-Aware Workflow Design proposal
   - Added detailed implementation for all phases
   - Documented artifact structures (JSON, CSV, MD formats)
   - Specified batch processing patterns
   - Created token budget comparison table
   - Added complete resumability guidelines
3. ✅ Incorporated token-aware workflow into Instructions document
   - Added "Token Management: CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS" section
   - Updated Phase 1 with batch processing guidance
   - Updated workflow timeline with token estimates
   - Added implementation checklists
4. ✅ Created tracking files
   - work-log.md (this file)
   - detailed-todo-list.md (comprehensive task breakdown)
5. ✅ Committed changes to git (3 commits)
   - bf7cf48 "Complete and incorporate token-aware workflow design"
   - 7c95081 "Add tracking files for token-aware workflow"
   - [pending] "Begin Phase 0: Create call inventory and artifacts directory"
6. ✅ Explored repository structure
   - Discovered 16 calls (not 15)
   - Identified 3 call types: Hybrid, Check-in, Topical
   - Mapped file structure (VTT transcripts, chat logs, AI summaries)
7. ✅ Started Phase 0: Multi-Call Mapping
   - Created _artifacts/ directory
   - Created call-inventory.csv (complete)
   - Created phase-0-summary.md (initial documentation)

### Tokens Used
- Session total: ~57K tokens
- Reading initial files: ~30K
- Completing proposal and instructions: ~16K
- Creating tracking files and Phase 0 work: ~11K

### Current State
- **Branch**: claude/token-aware-workflow-01Y9h2r2b2VrDjeczZBW6FNd
- **Files created/modified**:
  - Proposal for Token-Aware Workflow Design.md (completed - 535 lines)
  - Instructions for AI Assistant - Handling Many Calls Together.md (updated with token mgmt)
  - work-log.md (this file)
  - detailed-todo-list.md (comprehensive breakdown)
  - _artifacts/call-inventory.csv (16 calls documented)
  - _artifacts/phase-0-summary.md (mapping summary)
- **Phase 0 progress**: Inventory complete, still need participant matrix and topic clustering
- **Calls discovered**: 16 total (July 31 - Nov 13, 2025)
  - 11 Hybrid calls
  - 3 Check-in calls
  - 3 Topical calls (Collaboration, Abundance, Crony Capitalism)

### Key Discoveries
- Repository contains 16 calls, not 15 as initially expected
- Last call (Nov 13) split into 2 parts
- Each call has: VTT transcript, chat log, AI-generated summary PDF
- Call series: Open Global Mind (OGM)
- Date range: 2025-07-31 through 2025-11-13 (3.5 months, mostly weekly)

### Next Steps for Session 2
1. Complete Phase 0 remaining tasks:
   - Create participant-attendance.csv (scan transcripts for names)
   - Create topic-clusters.json (initial topic mapping)
   - Document check-in analysis
   - Commit complete Phase 0 artifacts
2. Adjust batch planning for 16 calls instead of 15
3. Begin Phase 1 Batch 1 (Calls 01-03)

### Notes
- Token management approach working well - minimal tokens for Phase 0 mapping
- Structured artifacts (CSV, MD) enable low-token tracking
- Ready to resume at any point with clear documentation
- Next session can pick up exactly where this left off
