00:19:19	Klaus Mager:	“I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”
— Philippians 4:11–13 (NIV)

00:21:04	Pete Kaminski:	john: flow of abundance vs. hoarding of abundance
00:21:12	Jerry Michalski:	abundant flow
00:21:44	Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach:	Replying to "abundant flow"

The word "affluent" comes from the Latin "affluens," meaning "flowing toward" or "abounding," derived from "affluere," which combines "ad" (to) and "fluere" (to flow). It has been used in English since the 15th century to describe wealth and abundance.
00:23:38	Pete Kaminski:	Jerry: Scarcity equals abundance minus trust.
00:24:49	Klaus Mager:	Inner Sufficiency
Abundance isn’t measured by possessions but by the absence of tanha (craving, grasping).
A person with little, but who is free from endless wanting, experiences abundance in the form of contentment (santutthi).

In ancient Greek debates, peitho (persuasion) is often contrasted with bia (force). Some rhetorical theory texts examine the tension between persuasion and coercion (i.e. rhetorical “force”). See “peitho and bia: the force of language” (Foley) discussing how persuasion and force are treated as opposites in classical thought. 

In dialogues like Gorgias, Socrates criticizes rhetoric as flattery, manipulation, and “an art of producing belief rather than knowledge.” He suggests that persuasive rhetoric can corrupt morals or bypass reason.
