00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Life, how about…

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.179
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'm sorry, we have bells going off here, I apologize for that. Where is that coming from?

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.639
Jerry Michalski: No worries about the bells.

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.000
Jerry Michalski: We're not… I don't think we're hearing them here, they might be in your background.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.179
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Zoom does a good job of eliminating background sounds.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.049
Jerry Michalski: It does. It's got nice filters. This is the Open Global Mind Weekly Call on Thursday, September 25th, 2025.

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:42.189
Jerry Michalski: Gil was just reporting in on the many different Zoom meeting assistants he's been trying out, and a bit of an addiction, and how he had withdrawal from getting off Facebook just recently. And I was reminded of the scene in French Connection Part 2, I think.

8
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:58.000
Jerry Michalski: Where the French mafia addicts Popeye Doyle to heroin, and then he has to go cold turkey, and there's… I think I remember a really good scene… I was young. I was a little young for an R-rated movie back then, but I remember a scene where he goes through withdrawal, and it was my first exposure to that.

9
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.229
Jerry Michalski: What happens that way.

10
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.739
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I don't remember that at all. All I remember from that movie is the car chase under the elevated trains.

11
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.590
Jerry Michalski: Yep.

12
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.860
Jerry Michalski: Which, apparently, they didn't have a lot of clearance to do that. It's… the story, I think, is that they just kind of winged it.

13
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:28.230
Alex Kladitis: Sorry, Jerry, just to… for posterity, and because we're recording this, just to clarify, that was the first time you said you went… you realized what cold turkey was, one of the many you've been through? Is that what you're suggesting?

14
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.900
Jerry Michalski: I did not suggest that, but but yeah.

15
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.090
Alex Kladitis: By the way, if I disappear, we've had two parkheads in the last,

16
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.819
Alex Kladitis: hour or so, so if I disappear, it's not because of something you've said.

17
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.550
Alex Kladitis: Or anyone said, it's because we had a popcup.

18
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.340
Jerry Michalski: Stranger.

19
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.600
Alex Kladitis: strange new world of ours, two and a half years, I saw someone

20
00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:05.200
Alex Kladitis: working on a local substation, asked him what he was doing. He said they were… they were joining up extra parts of power into the substation, so if one path cuts out, there's another one kicks in straight away.

21
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.699
Alex Kladitis: We've had plenty of pod cuts since then, whatever the…

22
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.590
Stacey Druss: PowerPoint.

23
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.590
Alex Kladitis: Would you?

24
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.110
Jerry Michalski: I know the system is.

25
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.400
Alex Kladitis: Yeah, whatever the system is, it doesn't work.

26
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.680
Alex Kladitis: Order.

27
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.939
Jerry Michalski: Clearly an improvement.

28
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.309
Alex Kladitis: Well, they spent money, economy worked, people got shares, you know, shareholdings or whatever.

29
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.310
Jerry Michalski: Yep.

30
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.610
Alex Kladitis: System kicks on, moves on.

31
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.380
Jerry Michalski: Cool.

32
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.799
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, I am reading your email, and I think it's a nice idea.

33
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.509
Jerry Michalski: about the topic. I can either read what you just said, or you can explain what you said. Which do you prefer?

34
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.760
Stacey Druss: Well, if you understood it from reading it, I trust they will understand it.

35
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.280
Jerry Michalski: Cool. I think I'll just read it in in a sec.

36
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.339
Jerry Michalski: Where's everybody?

37
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.679
Jerry Michalski: Is there enough going on in the world for you?

38
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.420
Jerry Michalski: Cheer.

39
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.569
Jerry Michalski: Kind of crazy times.

40
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:25.980
Jerry Michalski: Let's dive into the topic, and I'll read, I'll read Stacy's note to the open global mind list, which is, Hi gang, for the topic of abundance, I'd like to request trying out a simple speed round exercise before going into our usual rounds of conversation

41
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:36.140
Jerry Michalski: I propose that we each say, in a few words, think of it as a title, phrase, headline, bumper sticker, whatever you want to call it, that only answers the what it is.

42
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.160
Jerry Michalski: Refrain from adding the how, where, when, and why. Just what abundance is, I think you're saying.

43
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:59.390
Jerry Michalski: Yes. At least for this quick run. Anyone can choose to say pass. Thank you for consideration. At least you didn't say thank you for attention to this matter, which is how Trump ends many of his incredible Truth Social posts, which is, of course, the source of news these days. That's how policy's made.

44
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:12.149
Stacey Druss: Which is why the wink was there, to make sure that you made that connection between attention and consideration, and the parallel between what I was saying and what Trump was saying. So there's a reason for that wink.

45
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.189
Jerry Michalski: Very nice, very nice. There's a wink and also hearts, so…

46
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.799
Stacey Druss: Love that. I thought the hearts were obvious.

47
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:38.300
Jerry Michalski: Beautiful. That sounds great. So, why don't we make a little circle of the room and see what, what, just the what, not the how, why, what, not the explanatory stuff, and just a short phrase, it's a, it's a, it's our quick round robin, so don't go way deep, but think about what abundance

48
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.499
Jerry Michalski: is. And, I think I'll just ask for volunteers, whoever would like to go.

49
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.790
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, why don't you go first?

50
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.060
Stacey Druss: Because I thought about it.

51
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.310
Jerry Michalski: Love, love that.

52
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.880
Stacey Druss: Abundance for me is having what you need when you need it.

53
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.149
Jerry Michalski: Are we done? Is that good for everybody?

54
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.480
Stacey Druss: Sure, yeah.

55
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.850
Stacey Druss: That's the point.

56
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.999
Stacey Druss: We can add later.

57
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.780
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I'll go.

58
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.390
Jerry Michalski: Please.

59
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.419
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Jerry, I like your manner of asking for all the volunteers, that's excellent.

60
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.500
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: I immediately thought of the passage in PirKayavot, the wisdom of the Father, wisdom of the ancestors. It said, who is rich?

61
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.870
Stacey Druss: The person who is content with their lot.

62
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.169
Jerry Michalski: Intent with their luck.

63
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.010
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Content.

64
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.720
Jerry Michalski: Content, yes, I'm glad I thought I said.

65
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.230
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Shop.

66
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.970
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Gil. Who's next?

67
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.130
Jerry Michalski: everybody's being so pithy, and, like, right on, right on mission here. I'm a little, like…

68
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.299
Jerry Michalski: It's early, how'd that happen?

69
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.080
jessie: I'll go. Hi, Jerry. Hi, everyone.

70
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.690
Stacey Druss: Jesse?

71
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.379
jessie: Hi. I'm gonna say… Ikigai.

72
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.940
Jerry Michalski: Ikigai. So the, the overlapping diagram, Of, what you…

73
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.120
jessie: Love, do what you are good at, do what the world needs, and do what you can pay… get paid for.

74
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.150
Jerry Michalski: There we go.

75
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.630
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. Who else would like to go?

76
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.430
Jerry Michalski: Abundance.

77
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.780
Alex Kladitis: Oh, by the way, I'll just pass on that one.

78
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.440
Jerry Michalski: Alex passes.

79
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.830
Jerry Michalski: Excellent.

80
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.380
Pete Kaminski: Pete, Rick, Doug, Klaus? I have an oblique, contribution. Love is all you need.

81
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.230
Jerry Michalski: Cool.

82
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.880
Klaus Mager: Yeah, I would… Framing along the same lines as skilled abundance.

83
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:54.080
Klaus Mager: Is, is, to be at peace with, you know, what, with the gifts you have been given.

84
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.219
Doug Breitbart: For me, I think, infinite possibility.

85
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.909
Jerry Michalski: Infinite possibility, love that.

86
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.950
Jerry Michalski: John, you've come into…

87
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.929
Jerry Michalski: We're doing a very quick round on what abundance means, what we think abundance is in, like, a phrase or sentence or bumper sticker.

88
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.619
Jerry Michalski: And we're two-thirds of the way through the group.

89
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.500
Jerry Michalski: So if you'd like to jump in, that's good. I'm going to be slightly controversial, and I'm going to say abundance is more than enough.

90
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.620
John Warinner: That's a good answer.

91
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.989
Jerry Michalski: Who else would like to jump in?

92
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:59.540
John Warinner: Well, I apologize for being late, but I'll roll with what you said, Jerry. More than enough is a good way to frame it.

93
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.220
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. Rick, Foss?

94
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:10.510
Jerry Michalski: Class went. Oh, that's right, that's right, class went. Rick, can you hear us? Come in, Rick. Come in, Rick.

95
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.349
Rick Botelho: Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, I'm just, co-intelligence.

96
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.290
Jerry Michalski: Abundance is co-intelligence.

97
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.020
Jerry Michalski: Alright.

98
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.470
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

99
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.430
Stacey Druss: Yo, everybody.

100
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.799
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, that worked well. Thanks, Stacy.

101
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:34.579
Jerry Michalski: So… Pete has a whole new avatar picture for his… I was like, oh wait, wait, this is new.

102
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.439
Jerry Michalski: It's like when we change our hairdo, like, what happened? Wait.

103
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:52.980
Jerry Michalski: So, I'm really interested in the contrast, because back in the day, Diamandis and Kotler wrote Abundance, and they kind of meant

104
00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:04.070
Jerry Michalski: We now have the capacity to make, between nanotech and endless energy and all these sort of… it was a techno-optimist manifesto of sorts.

105
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:22.609
Jerry Michalski: And it comes from a place of, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, like, we could… we could just overwhelm all these places where there is scarcity with… with technology. And it's a little light on the barriers and between belief systems and regulations and politics and all that kind of stuff. It's pretty light on that.

106
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.110
Jerry Michalski: I've not read either of these books in full, but,

107
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:47.559
Jerry Michalski: But it was very much in a techno-optimist vein. Then, very recently, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson wrote Abundance, which I think doesn't have a subtitle, which has become a piece of the democratic movement, and was saying, hey, one of the things that's preventing us from getting abundance on things like housing and other social goods

108
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:59.429
Jerry Michalski: is over-regulation and constraints, and some people are critiquing this view as being kind of neoliberal. It's very much, let's get the government, let's get regs out of the way so that we can generate abundance for everybody.

109
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:23.580
Jerry Michalski: which is possible if we sort of let people get things built and done. The book, I think, has a very nice critique of progressives and liberals who have layered in so many regs that it's hard to do things. I have a friend who's in commercial real estate here in Portland, and you only need to, like, glance at this topic, and he will regale you with stories about why it's

110
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.010
Jerry Michalski: So, so difficult.

111
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:39.400
Jerry Michalski: To get things built or done, here in Portland. And then… and then… I've got a point of view on abundance that I'll just put in… put in the room, which is that

112
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:55.320
Jerry Michalski: humans who know how to live in community on the commons create abundance in many ways together, and that it requires trust to do so. And so I created a little formula that I like called scarcity equals abundance minus trust.

113
00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:02.410
Jerry Michalski: Which is not about either of the things that I just mentioned, the other two approaches from the other two books. It's more that

114
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:23.729
Jerry Michalski: In places around the world, we used to know how to create abundance, and we didn't have to worry people could be happy and well-fed and live well. In some cases, Aboriginal cultures in Australia, for example, way before the advent of things like money, you know, the payment of rent for shelter, all those kinds of things.

115
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:38.399
Jerry Michalski: And by raising this, I don't mean we should all abandon our homes and all currency and go back to a nomadic lifestyle, but I do mean that if we can manage to,

116
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.109
Jerry Michalski: Achieve small degrees of cooperation.

117
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:59.229
Jerry Michalski: a little bit like what Rick was saying a moment ago, that we can collectively create abundance much more than we think we can. That abundance is kind of at hand in how we think of resources and stewardship versus ownership and other things like that.

118
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:20.339
Jerry Michalski: Kevin and Kalia and Jose, we just did a little lightning round a moment ago about what we think abundance means. If it was a bumper sticker, kind of a really short phrase, you know, a bumper sticker or sentence, if you'd like to take a swing at that, we'd love to hear what you think abundance means. You can also pass.

119
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.380
Kevin Jones: Pooled and shared resources with, mission-focused local investing.

120
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.980
Jerry Michalski: Cool, got some specifics there. Kalia?

121
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.919
Kaliya Identity Woman: I really… like, something that I've heard as sort of, a way…

122
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:49.110
Kaliya Identity Woman: To get us through the wormhole that we're in, which is abundant enoughness.

123
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:58.060
Kaliya Identity Woman: Like, there's a really a significant… Challenge, where…

124
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.929
Kaliya Identity Woman: People who have a lot, a lot are…

125
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.970
Kaliya Identity Woman: Continue to want a lot, and like…

126
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:20.729
Kaliya Identity Woman: Like, how do people get into their nervous system like they actually have enough, and they don't need to, like, accumulate more, and they can…

127
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:31.970
Kaliya Identity Woman: choose to, like, co-create community together, because I'm in a bunch of circles… Where… Like, people's…

128
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:40.160
Kaliya Identity Woman: Including this one. People say lots of nice things. Where's our community where some of us are living together?

129
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:58.320
Kaliya Identity Woman: you know, I'm a… anyway, so abundant enoughness as a kind of frame, that is a sense of being that we can get into, so then that people…

130
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.320
Kaliya Identity Woman: Those with resources are actually aligning and

131
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:11.320
Kaliya Identity Woman: You know, and also, how are those people with resources, like, asking deeper questions about why are people hoarding?

132
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:17.909
Kaliya Identity Woman: They're hoarding for good reason, so how do we help meet their needs without the need to hoard?

133
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.700
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Goya.

134
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.880
Jerry Michalski: Jose, did you want to jump in with… short…

135
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.549
Jose Leal: I, to be honest, I'm not sure what abundance means.

136
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.140
Jerry Michalski: from…

137
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.300
Jose Leal: it's… It seems to be a good…

138
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.480
Jose Leal: Catchphrase that we've all picked up, and a lot of us are talking about.

139
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:52.119
Jose Leal: But, I think abundance comes from technology, for the most part, whatever technology that means.

140
00:14:52.950 --> 00:15:00.070
Jose Leal: Right? Social technology, physical technology, artifacts,

141
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:10.300
Jose Leal: Is that what we mean by… by it? I don't know. I struggle with really sort of grasping what abundance means in these contexts.

142
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:19.120
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Jose. And I'll just add, there's a book from 2010 by Juliet Shore titled Plenitudes, The New Economics of True Wealth.

143
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:33.099
Jerry Michalski: which plays with that notion that abundance is too much, that the goal of abundance winds up being a little bit like Pete just posted in the chat about consumer abundance. He writes, the paradox of abundance. We live in a world where you have a practical abundance of many things.

144
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:44.550
Jerry Michalski: food, technology, consumer goods, but overabundance of some, for some people can cause addiction, affliction, disease, and the abundance isn't well distributed. Many people are starving and without basic needs. Totally agree.

145
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:57.060
Jerry Michalski: And so there's, like, this mirage that we all desire abundance, and I'm… I'm interested in Kalia's hack of the brain, of how do we convince more people that when they've got enough.

146
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:14.119
Jerry Michalski: It's… it's good. They're gonna be fine, they're gonna be fine. More might actually even be damaging in different ways, either to them or their family or society. We don't know. But… but clearly society is not very oriented in that way. With that, I will turn to the hands queue and go to Gil.

147
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:25.510
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah. Yeah. Notable to me that until Pete's, ad in the chat, none of us was talking about abundance as being lots of stuff.

148
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:39.699
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I'll echo for those who came in later, my comment at the beginning was to reach back to a Jewish wisdom text called Pirkeavot, The Wisdom of the Ancestors, that asks, who is rich? The person who is content with their lot.

149
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:46.360
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which I think is the mood of a lot of the comments, that I've heard here. Jerry, you're,

150
00:16:46.900 --> 00:17:02.470
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Your framing had a lot of moving parts in it, but I just want to pick up on the… on the books. I haven't read either of them either. I know that I really need to read Ezra Klein, because of where it is in the contemporary dialogue, but I'm really struck by how… how off

151
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:13.530
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: the debate over too much regulation versus too little regulation is. We, all of us, depend on it, and there's too much in many places. I mean, I live in Berkeley, I know a little bit about housing regulation, being a pain in the ass.

152
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:32.249
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But, you know, these things happen because people built buildings that fell down on people's heads and were fire traps and etc. So, you know, that's part of what the Commons does, is set boundaries of what we do together. And so… and I've had, in my professional work, I've had a bit to do with intelligent regulation.

153
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.850
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: where,

154
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:47.850
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Where businesses can actually embrace it, because it provides certainty and clarity, and not burdensome paperwork barriers to getting things done, but makes things work better. And it's a question of how they're designed, and by whom, and for what.

155
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.859
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: So, it's an example of just, you know.

156
00:17:51.720 --> 00:18:04.999
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And I don't know if I'm… I don't know if I'm accurately blaming Klein for this. I generally like his work, but I'm surprised by what I hear about this book as being, you know, a kind of, you know, maybe a seriously misframed argument.

157
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.639
Jerry Michalski: Which is part of what I was hoping we would sort of touch in this conversation. Thanks for putting that on the table, Gil.

158
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.260
Jerry Michalski: John.

159
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:29.820
John Warinner: Yeah, this isn't a… well, I'll just say, I'm… I'm interested also in the connection, and this goes back to Kalia's comment, is the term affluence, which, you know, has gotten a little bit of a…

160
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:39.650
John Warinner: bad association, like, with affluenza and that kind of thing, but, like, you go back to the… to the origins of affluence, and it's abundant flow.

161
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:56.260
John Warinner: And so I think… I think when you're talking about abundance, it's also important, you know, to think of that verb element of it. You know, the flow, of abundance versus the hoarding of abundance, I think, is a real key,

162
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:17.099
John Warinner: And I think it's… I think it's interesting, you know, how words… the meanings of words change over time, but with the origin of affluence, affluence, you know, that's… there's a fluor… fluid flow, you know, element to that, and so the idea of… in today's culture, where affluence

163
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:30.119
John Warinner: you know, the mental picture that may come to mind is this hoarding, you know, accrual type of thing is not what that term was originally, you know, pointing to at all, so I think that's important.

164
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:40.790
Jerry Michalski: I love that. Thank you, John. And I think abundant flow, the perception of abundant flow, is what causes people to relax and think maybe they don't need to hoard.

165
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:47.460
Jerry Michalski: So, seeing that there's more than enough for everybody in whatever the resource is that they're talking about.

166
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.010
Jerry Michalski: I think lets people relax, so there's, I think, a bunch of nuance there about

167
00:19:52.540 --> 00:20:00.980
Jerry Michalski: what we perceive to be available, how durable we think it'll be, you know, all that kind of thing. Gil, I think your hand is still up from earlier.

168
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.840
Jerry Michalski: So I'll go to class.

169
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.749
Klaus Mager: Yeah, I think the way we perceive abundance depends very much on

170
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:19.360
Klaus Mager: On our personal position to it, our… the way we see ourselves and the world around us, because there's no way that…

171
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:34.769
Klaus Mager: physical goods and physical well-being can… is… will ever be evenly distributed. There will always be some who have more than others. But the… the… both… both in the New Testament way of thinking, in Buddhism.

172
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:51.970
Klaus Mager: You know, it's about how you position yourself within the world around you. So the notion of suffering, you know, do you cause yourself to suffer by… by wanting, you know, by wishing to have, and so on. And so… so I think it's… it's… it's a very unique concept.

173
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.610
Klaus Mager: On a very individual level.

174
00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:09.900
Jerry Michalski: And also has really interesting complications on a cultural, societal level around the world. There are lots of, I think, different perceptions of it that only a few of which we're probably aware of in different ways.

175
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.430
Jerry Michalski: Jesse, please.

176
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.939
Jessie Upp: Thanks, Jared. Can you repeat that statement that you said about abundance without trust? Can you repeat that?

177
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.429
Jerry Michalski: Of course, scarcity equals abundance minus trust, meaning.

178
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.100
Jessie Upp: Thank you.

179
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.019
Jerry Michalski: Meaning humans knew how to create abundance, but it took trust to do it.

180
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:39.239
Jerry Michalski: So when you squish out the trust in those systems, you get scarcity. And then capitalism, by the way, loves scarcity. I went to visit school where they teach you that scarcity equals value.

181
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:49.559
Jerry Michalski: And what they mean, partly, is that unless there's scarcity, there's no business model, so you better create some scarcity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and I never, I never liked that framing at all.

182
00:21:50.610 --> 00:22:12.529
Jessie Upp: Yeah, thank you for that. And then John's, version of without hoarding, it seems like that statement could be used without hoarding as well. And you said something about if you have enough, then there's no… maybe there's no tendency to, and I heard this story of a person overseas who, was with someone who was panhandling, I don't know the word these days, but…

183
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:27.049
Jessie Upp: And he, he was in the more poor part of the neighborhood, and he said, he walked by, and he's like, why don't you just go up the street in the richer part of the neighborhood? And he's like, oh, I've done that. They don't give as much.

184
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.840
Jessie Upp: And so…

185
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:39.839
Jessie Upp: it… I'm seeing that people, when you get enough, it's not enough ever, it's, like, evolutionary. And also, I want to bring up the book that was given to me the other day called Pendulum.

186
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:51.710
Jessie Upp: And, it's like every 40 years, we go from me to we, and not the me to we that we know of, but a different kind of, cooperative version of life that,

187
00:22:51.750 --> 00:23:05.779
Jessie Upp: was spoken about, to more of individualism, and it's like a system, this just pendulum that's kind of… we're in it, and we're, not necessarily everywhere in the world, I guess, but definitely in America. I can see that.

188
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.909
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. Sean, please.

189
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:24.839
John Warinner: I just wanna… just wanna riff off what Klaus said and what you said, Jerry, about scarcity equals abundance minus trust. In my experience, scarcity can also equal abundance minus awareness.

190
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:32.760
John Warinner: gave a presentation to a group of agricultural producers up in Walla Walla a year ago.

191
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:47.780
John Warinner: Where I went through this whole thing of the hydrographs, the stream flow, the amount of water flowing through the watershed, and I finished my presentation, and it was silent, and then this one guy spoke up and said, I don't know that I believe what you just said.

192
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:56.129
John Warinner: And, I mean, it's like, there was no conjecture or anything in it, it was just all, you know, streamflow gauges and mathematics and whatnot.

193
00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:03.959
John Warinner: But it… but it drove home to me, like, here I had this pretty clear picture in my mind of the abundance

194
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:09.070
John Warinner: And these other guys in the room, like, didn't have that mental picture at all.

195
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:26.129
John Warinner: And I think trust is an issue there, but upstream of trust is… like, if you're not even aware of the abundance, or as Klaus said, if you're… your perspective, you're seeing the system like you don't have water, then water is scarce. If you have plenty of water.

196
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.699
John Warinner: water is abundant, and I agree, I agree with that.

197
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:40.029
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. There's a bunch of interesting interlocking concepts here. Klaus was putting in the chat about Tanha and Santuti.

198
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.999
Jerry Michalski: different concepts, I think, from Sanskrit.

199
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:50.360
Jerry Michalski: And there's also a parigiraha, which is non-grasping, so it's similar. And these are all…

200
00:24:50.530 --> 00:25:04.690
Jerry Michalski: These are… sorry, aparagraha is one of the yamas, or abstinences, of yoga, of original yoga from Patanjali. Yoga was a mental practice for a long, long, long time before it was a physical practice with asanas.

201
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:18.050
Jerry Michalski: And it has really good advice for living. It's really nicely done, and if more of us paid attention to some of the precepts there, maybe we would have more abundance collectively.

202
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.170
Jerry Michalski: I'm also struck with

203
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:28.079
Jerry Michalski: water, there's a name for this, sort of watershed management. There's a different word for it, but,

204
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:37.100
Jerry Michalski: Working your land with swales and other kinds of things so that you have… your land catches and holds, retains more water.

205
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:52.039
Jerry Michalski: than industrially farmed land or other kinds of lands do. And that creates an abundance of water on your property. Dave Witzel and his wife Claudia and I visited Jumping Frogs Farms in… way above Petaluma many, many years ago.

206
00:25:52.100 --> 00:26:09.479
Jerry Michalski: And we were talking to the two… the couple who owned the farm, and they said, you know, there was a really bad rainstorm last season, and I was sitting at home reading a book by the fireplace, and I got a call from a neighbor who said, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, do you guys need help? And all their neighbors were industrial farmers.

207
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:23.099
Jerry Michalski: And then the neighbor was like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you need help, we're flooding, we have all kinds of bad things happening. And she described to us how, they had a bunch of ponds and a bunch of very absorbent land on their property. Nothing bad was happening to their property because

208
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:31.020
Jerry Michalski: it was equipped to actually soak in really nice rains, and she was not worried. She was busy, like, enjoying reading a book.

209
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.520
Jerry Michalski: so that's a form of abundance. Jesse, can you say a little bit more about pendulum?

210
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.190
Jessie Upp: Oh, well, the… the core theory is that

211
00:26:44.560 --> 00:27:00.389
Jessie Upp: There's two extremes that we oscillate from me periods of, like, individual… like, self-focused, and we periods that are collective and community-focused, and this pattern is kind of like a 40-year swing between those extremes.

212
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:06.480
Jessie Upp: And where, like, there's a fulcrum of where the early 2000s

213
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.449
Jessie Upp: And the early 60s make opposite ends.

214
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.389
Jessie Upp: And it's kind of reflected in music.

215
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.749
Jessie Upp: And art trends, and those societal swings are…

216
00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:23.119
Jessie Upp: Like, just 10-year periods where they behave in predictable ways.

217
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:30.350
Jessie Upp: And it traces back all the way back 3,000 years. And they kind of say how the East reflects the West.

218
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.510
Jessie Upp: 40 years…

219
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:46.750
Jessie Upp: behind, kind of thing, so I'm not sure. I haven't, like, read the whole book, but it was an interesting concept. It seems like it's mathematical, but, you know, everything's not predictable and human. But that's… it was an interesting thing to see.

220
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:51.680
Jerry Michalski: Lovely. Thank you for sharing that. I hadn't heard about the book, and, I'm really…

221
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:58.959
Jerry Michalski: It's interesting. How is it… it was written in 2012. How has it not gotten more attention?

222
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:12.209
Jessie Upp: Well, I would definitely look at it and, you know, see maybe why, but I haven't found it… I didn't go deep enough to figure that out, but I see that there might be business implications for…

223
00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:17.539
Jessie Upp: You know, why successful politicians or entertainers succeed.

224
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:35.610
Jessie Upp: Based on the pendulum swing that we're in, like, certain music and certain words, like, I'm starting to hear the same kind of music that we did in the 70s right now, and there's, like, the bell bottoms, we came back, and it was a brief thing, but, you know, it just is interesting. It's enough to be, like,

225
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:53.829
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, exactly. And there's a whole class of literature on cyclical theories of history, from the Great Transition to the Fourth Turning to, I don't know, there's like a… this is a whole class of literature, but this one seems like a really pragmatic explanation. It's like, things here, here, this is how things swing.

226
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:59.450
Jessie Upp: Yeah, and, like, it's weird that, you know, we have this community-centered purpose, like, how can I serve

227
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:13.800
Jessie Upp: is, you know, a very strong book at one point that aligns with that we society, but I don't know, what is Trump? Like, it's a very interesting conversation. Thanks for asking.

228
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.930
Jerry Michalski: Love that. Yeah, thanks for bringing the book to our attention. I really appreciate it.

229
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.570
Jerry Michalski: the edition of the conversation. Stacy.

230
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:34.629
Stacey Druss: Yeah, so if I can just start from where I am and connect to what a lot of you have said, and Jerry, I totally… I think you're spot on with… I know you're spot on with the trust thing, but I want to mention how media

231
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:48.450
Stacey Druss: and billionaires and the conflicting stories are eroding that trust and how it pertains to now. Kalia put a comment in about the need for housing and free transit, and

232
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.729
Stacey Druss: A lot of the conversations I have are around what's happening in New York City with Mondani.

233
00:29:54.910 --> 00:30:13.140
Stacey Druss: And I just want to read to you one of the comments that I got in my private messages, because it ties into some other things that are happening that have to do with free speech, and all the other cultural things that are happening that the media is a big part of. So this is the message I got.

234
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:22.519
Stacey Druss: You cunt, whole, Arab, lover, cunt. Get the fuck out of New York. That scumbag will not be mayor, you cunt.

235
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.640
Stacey Druss: This is just one of many that I get.

236
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.679
Jerry Michalski: That's Scott.

237
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.300
Stacey Druss: Probably.

238
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.539
Stacey Druss: That being said.

239
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.490
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Stacy, why do you… why do you stay for that?

240
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.780
Stacey Druss: I'm speaking, excuse me.

241
00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.300
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Okay.

242
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.569
Stacey Druss: People get this all the time, and free speech is a very big issue.

243
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.300
Stacey Druss: I know from speaking to people in other states.

244
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:56.200
Stacey Druss: I know from my friends in Florida that there were tanks that drove by in Black neighborhoods that were meant to intimidate people.

245
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.760
Klaus Mager: Into not voting.

246
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:04.829
Stacey Druss: I'm very clear on what's been happening for years, and I'm very clear that nobody's gonna shut me up.

247
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:23.419
Stacey Druss: I was out the other night, and somebody… a friend came up to me and hugged me, and she said, am I going to get put on a list? And she said it half-jokingly, but we weren't really joking. Anyway, what I wanted… so I got in a conversation, and my conversations now are mostly local, and by…

248
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:32.989
Stacey Druss: So, I put up a post, and it was about Cat Stevens tickets being $632, because the argument I get from

249
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:46.089
Stacey Druss: people that are affluent in my community is all the businesses are gonna leave New York City if we elect Montani. I'm sorry, this is my new foster dog, and there's a story behind him, too.

250
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.310
Jerry Michalski: Hmm, okay.

251
00:31:49.930 --> 00:32:03.320
Stacey Druss: So, I have people that are now defending the billionaires, and they're afraid that the billionaires are going to leave New York City if, heaven forbid, we have affordable housing and free transportation.

252
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:11.070
Stacey Druss: This gives me an opportunity to speak to them. The gentleman that posted that, I then took his post.

253
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:18.559
Stacey Druss: and publicly put it right up there, because after I looked through his page and saw all of his Jesus quotes.

254
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:23.499
Stacey Druss: I wanted the community to see who this guy is. I'm not afraid of him.

255
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:41.709
Stacey Druss: So, in answer to your question, Gil, I keep doing it because I know that there are good people on both sides, especially in my community. And I know that there was a lot of manipulation. Very quick, short story that will also answer that, if I may.

256
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:47.169
Stacey Druss: Well, maybe… You know, I'm gonna stop, take care of the dog.

257
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.859
Stacey Druss: And then hopefully I'll get the opportunity to speak again later.

258
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.740
Stacey Druss: Yeah, let me do that, thank you.

259
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:55.680
Jerry Michalski: Cool.

260
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.590
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

261
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.350
Jerry Michalski: Kevin?

262
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.249
Kevin Jones: Yeah, abundance. So I'm doing a thing to create it. I'd like to describe, if I could, for a minute.

263
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:27.619
Kevin Jones: You know, we lost our house, and it's actually in the phrase, uninhabitable. We didn't lose it. It could be redone. And one in six people in my neighborhood, I just want to know, a low-status, unincorporated neighborhood, lost their houses. Higher… highest of anything in the

264
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.409
Kevin Jones: In the southeast, and

265
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.949
Kevin Jones: So we're gonna do a non-profit housing fund.

266
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:52.510
Kevin Jones: And because it's a non-profit, it means everybody can talk about it. And so, you know, a PTA officer can talk to a volleyball coach about it. And it'll be community-directed capital, and the community will get more money back than the affluent people who write big checks.

267
00:33:52.510 --> 00:34:05.809
Kevin Jones: And so we're going to use that to help this low-status neighborhood have a seat at the table. And there's starting a Latino business association, just the population grew by 18%, and it was the cheapest place, so…

268
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.010
Kevin Jones: It's a lot of Latino, but there's no…

269
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:16.589
Kevin Jones: codified way to… for aid groups to write them a check. The Restaurant Association had an association, and so there was a restaurant

270
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:34.840
Kevin Jones: Employee Support Fund, but the food trucks and caterers and Latino folks, there was no place to write a check, so they're creating an entity to be at the table, and it matters right now, because there are these small area plans being put out, and that's, like.

271
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:43.670
Kevin Jones: redesigning this place after the disaster, right? And one of them is the counties, and it's broad, and it's messy, but then there's a separate

272
00:34:43.670 --> 00:35:01.589
Kevin Jones: small area plan that's competing to be the story, and it's led by people with the Chamber of Commerce and realtors, and they only do outreach to Latinos, you know, on one occasion or whatever. But obviously, they're… they would cause displacement, right? Because they're… they're motivated

273
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.029
Kevin Jones: for increasing property values, and increasing property values puts the people who were at risk of

274
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:14.330
Kevin Jones: Because it's a place people already fled to. It's $100,000 less per house than the rest of the county, so more Latino, more…

275
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:27.920
Kevin Jones: Black folks that got, pushed away. And so we're going to create a political power using a fund, and then the fund will also have to increase biodiversity, because everybody's house is at risk because the ground got scoured.

276
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:35.669
Kevin Jones: So we have dead soil, and you need biodiversity to hold the soil to reduce the housing risk, so we can, we can, you know, we can…

277
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:46.750
Kevin Jones: we can measure the housing success by the health of the river, and then along with the number of people who are housed. So I think it's going to be a real popular story.

278
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:58.030
Kevin Jones: And and we got a whole lot of the partners engaged, and I got… you know, the best community organizer says this is a really good plan, and folks who are, you know.

279
00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:05.499
Kevin Jones: there's a real credible community group that we're designing it for, called Suanova Communities Together, and they're the…

280
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:19.740
Kevin Jones: social safety net below everybody else, you know, when you have no rent or a utility bill, you go to them, and they're doing about $60,000 a month. They've done that really good job, and they realize, well, we need to solve housing, you know.

281
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:32.279
Kevin Jones: 400 people lost their houses, so, so we're gonna start with housing and create biodiversity. So I think it should be pretty fun, and, you know, might even include my house, who knows, you know? So…

282
00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.349
Jerry Michalski: And that should be fun.

283
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:48.640
Jerry Michalski: Kevin, thank you for describing that. It is just curious, is that activity convincing you to stay closer to Suanoa? Because I think you've been pulled… you've been pulling… you've been pulling yourselves away from Swanonoa because it's just been so sad?

284
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:54.260
Kevin Jones: Yeah, you know, that's interesting, because we moved to the River Arts District, which is a highly,

285
00:36:54.530 --> 00:37:09.409
Kevin Jones: access place. You know, it's… it's where the artists are, and they want to be more like this road in Santa Fe where rich folks come and buy art, and they don't live in the loss of being displaced is not a problem, and so the Chamber of Commerce and the Tourism Development is,

286
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:22.269
Kevin Jones: all behind the artists who were taking their well-resourced artists, taking their future in their hands, and so it's like, not much for me to do. And then this came along that somebody reached out and said, you know.

287
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:28.970
Kevin Jones: could you use some of this neighborhood economic stuff around the problems we're trying to address? You know, they're trying to do

288
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:44.460
Kevin Jones: food and housing and transportation, but housing is the one that's making everything worse. So we're gonna, you know, they lead, they're Latino and biracial and all that, and, you know, we're designing it for this really trusted community entity.

289
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:55.149
Kevin Jones: That has, you know, housing groups around it, mountain home, mountain housing, and habitat, and land trusts, you know, all kinds of big stakeholder resources around it.

290
00:37:55.150 --> 00:38:06.160
Kevin Jones: But I don't think nobody's ever measured, you know, low-income housing to reducing risk by biodiversity, so I think that's kind of an intriguing,

291
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.379
Kevin Jones: Question that we want to do both of those things.

292
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:28.950
Jerry Michalski: I love that. Thanks, Kevin. And then you're making me wonder many things, one of which is, why aren't property and casualty insurance companies all over this? Why aren't they all into, sort of, the ecological ways to reduce environmental risks, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? They should be…

293
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:35.680
Jerry Michalski: They should be promoting, funding, explaining, storytelling, everything, and all the.

294
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.069
Kevin Jones: What are you doing?

295
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:52.199
Jerry Michalski: is, like, calculating, you know, calculating stats and then raising rates, or pulling out of dangerous reasons… regions because, well, it's uninsurable. We did what we could. We raised rates as far as we could, and then it's, you know, uninsurable. That maybe I'm just not perceiving their efforts, but…

296
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:58.700
Kevin Jones: some startups who were doing community-embedded insurance. You know, you're not able to make a profit on

297
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:15.820
Kevin Jones: property now with climate things. It needs to be collectively owned, and the return goes back into reducing risk. That model makes sense. You know, the extracted profits, you know, in property insurance is short-term, and you need to put it into something that will

298
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:26.909
Kevin Jones: be there when things go worse, you know. So, we're linking in community-embedded insurances. You know, people are pooling and sharing their resources together, sharing risk.

299
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:29.899
Kevin Jones: So, you know, and then the community owns the balance sheet.

300
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:37.699
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, yeah, so let me pull on one more thing you said, which is, it seems like, terrible climate events are making places

301
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:51.849
Jerry Michalski: uninsurable or uninvestable as real estate, which is driving the collective… not collectivization, but community land trusts. Basically, the restructuring of ownership or stewardship of land, which is a good thing.

302
00:39:52.180 --> 00:40:07.979
Kevin Jones: The one session I'm moderating is the one that puts all weird stuff together. It's collective purchasing, and it's the library of things from Shareable, and it's a real grassroots crowdfunding. And so, what if you just pooled and shared your resources, but then you found a way to

303
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:13.419
Kevin Jones: for the community to invest alongside your pooling and sharing. I mean, nobody's done that. That would be a…

304
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.959
Kevin Jones: A really easy, you know,

305
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:26.309
Kevin Jones: too adhesive approach. We're looking for some of these things that you could launch together, where if you launch one, it helps the other. And some of those things are happening.

306
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:31.200
Kevin Jones: You know, there is infrastructure coming, you know, and so…

307
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:37.139
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. That was great. Really, super… I love what you're… what you're working on. Stacy…

308
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.000
Kevin Jones: Should be fun.

309
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.240
Jerry Michalski: Yeah.

310
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:50.950
Stacey Druss: I have a very cynical, conspiratorial answer to your question about insurance companies, and that is that I do believe they want people to lose their properties so that they can be bought up.

311
00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.730
Stacey Druss: Very simple.

312
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.109
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, I can smell the cynicism on that one. Thanks, Stacey.

313
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.099
Jerry Michalski: Pete…

314
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:19.169
Pete Kaminski: I wanted to chime in with some thoughts about that answer, too. As Stacy, I really like yours, and I think that happens, certainly. I think there's also a structural thing in the way that we run our economy, and hierarchical

315
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:34.539
Pete Kaminski: corporate entities and their decision-making. I think it's easy for people on the ground to see a situation and go, you know, there's a thoughtful system-friendly approach to

316
00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.390
Pete Kaminski: Making the situation better.

317
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:53.100
Pete Kaminski: But when you report to somebody who reports to somebody, reports to somebody, it goes up to the boardroom and the upper management, and they don't have that same nuance of decision making. So I think… I think we see over and over…

318
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.510
Pete Kaminski: Big hierarchical, corporate structures make really dumb decisions, not because…

319
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:08.079
Pete Kaminski: It's the best kind of decision to make, but we've rewarded the creation of these big, dumb hierarchical things that are…

320
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:15.309
Pete Kaminski: theoretically kind of easy to manage, and… and just accrete size. So…

321
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:24.680
Pete Kaminski: So, of course, they make dumb decisions, instead of thoughtful, systems-friendly approaches to situations on the ground.

322
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:26.870
Jerry Michalski: Thank you.

323
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:32.040
Jerry Michalski: I… I… I would love to hear from foresighted.

324
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:39.109
Jerry Michalski: business folks who are doing the opposite somewhere, that would be great. It'd be a joy to my heart.

325
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:48.799
Jerry Michalski: to have people jump into this conversation, like, no, no, no, we had this initiative, we did this thing, look, look, look, it's, you know, all over the place, but I'm not… I'm not seeing it yet.

326
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.710
Jessie Upp: While I'm working on one.

327
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.780
Jerry Michalski: Excellent.

328
00:42:53.780 --> 00:43:00.429
Jessie Upp: talking with the City of Seattle, I'm talking with, cooperatives, and we're starting to visualize,

329
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:13.590
Jessie Upp: place-based resources, not just talent, but also goods and services, so we can match them and start… I realize that when we start visualizing these resources, you can start seeing the gaps that Stacy starts seeing, you know.

330
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:25.870
Jessie Upp: when you verbalize that, that's one thing, but when you have… when you can… when you can visualize the dumb decisions and start looking at data-informed decisions, visualization really helps. So, Kevin.

331
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:39.540
Jessie Upp: I have lots of people who are stand for housing. It doesn't sound like you have an actual… you have everyone you need at the table for housing, but as we move away from conceptual definitions of abundance.

332
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:48.480
Jessie Upp: to meeting people's needs in a specific, place-based community, I sincerely believe that visualization of talents and goods and services.

333
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.490
Kevin Jones: Yeah.

334
00:43:49.490 --> 00:44:07.930
Jessie Upp: supports the needs of that community, and I would love to support and talk with you, because when we're working with land trusts, that's a perfect example of utilizing the fingers of, the people that they're working with. And so I'll just place… I'll put the mapping project we're putting down.

335
00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:20.169
Kevin Jones: I would love to talk to you about that. You know, I've done some pretty serious mapping. I was telling this story, if I can tell you a brief mapping story, it's kind of interesting, I think. I was working with Mark Beam, as some of you know, and Gary Bowles.

336
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:41.360
Kevin Jones: And we were mapping, the distribution of malaria nets in Uganda, linked to the Global Fund on AIDS and, you know, etc. And we were able to show that the nets were going to where Musveni's cronies were, as opposed to where the malaria area, there's a gray market in it.

337
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:53.550
Kevin Jones: And, you know, I was working with Jeffrey Sachs, which you should never do, at the Earth Institute, and he said, you know, I'm gonna hold up $40 million to Ms. Venney, and they said, dude.

338
00:44:53.560 --> 00:45:10.129
Kevin Jones: we move billions a year. You know, 70… $30 million is not going to make us have a conscience. You know, we won't take your money, we're taking everybody else's money, don't worry about it. And so he didn't realize that showing clearly that they were wrong

339
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:28.509
Kevin Jones: would not make them do… change their behavior at all, because the guy misread the power in the room. I mean, that's the problem with Jeffrey Sachs. He lives in this abstract world where he thought $30 million was going to make a billionaire grovel. So anyway, yeah, no, I believe in mapping. I think this really needs it.

340
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:38.570
Jessie Upp: And working with Uganda, I'm working with someone right now who, they haven't had food. You know, aid was removed from President Trump.

341
00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.290
Jessie Upp: They haven't had food for two and a half weeks.

342
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:47.020
Jessie Upp: And they're like, They don't… they're not a resilient, self-efficient.

343
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.150
Kevin Jones: Yeah. And so…

344
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:59.500
Jessie Upp: All they need is cook… used cooking oil to create soap, so they can create hygiene and have the business angle that he's going on. But right now, it's just like food. They don't have it. Two and a half weeks now.

345
00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.160
Jessie Upp: It's just really… it's… it's saddening, so…

346
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.869
Kevin Jones: I'd love to talk to you later in October, but my conference is coming up, like, in 3 days.

347
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:26.050
Kevin Jones: visualization for this project when I get back home. I think it's really important. Yeah, there's a lot of stories you can… because there's trails with markers and things here, right? I mean, so you could embed your content, you know, along this trail with this story. I mean, this is, you know, this trail is where the first massacre was, you know.

348
00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.849
Kevin Jones: That kind of thing. So, yeah, there's a lot of…

349
00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:38.440
Kevin Jones: Yeah, because, you know, people are doing greenways. There's a lot of money for greenways, and the greenways get markers, and there's QR codes, etc. There's stories you could,

350
00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:47.899
Kevin Jones: You know, because the housing fund will be lower risk if we're more biodiverse. So, you know, that's… people want to picture those two things together.

351
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.430
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, guys.

352
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.780
Jerry Michalski: Gil.

353
00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:13.459
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Yeah, I love the conversation about mapping both physical mapping and systems mapping, and causal loops, and all sorts of ways of helping people see and perceive the complexity they know. There's a guy named Scott Spann, who's done remarkable work with, multi-stakeholder community mapping, where people, a large group of people, build the maps together.

354
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:24.950
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And, you know, there'll be a… there'll be a starting… maybe a starting point hypothetical map, and the question is, okay, what… what in your world are you not seeing on the wall? Put it on.

355
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:34.139
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And they keep doing that until it's a complete representation of all the stakeholders in the community. It's driven some remarkable projects of transformation. Kevin, I want to connect you up with him.

356
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:45.260
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: After the conference, perhaps. And, I'd love to be in this conversation you guys are having. Back on the insurance… excuse me… back on the insurance theme.

357
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:54.960
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: You know, we see this really starkly in the aftermath of the LA fires, where the state's response was, let's lighten the regulations so people can rebuild faster.

358
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.750
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Rather than, let's have regulations that have.

359
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.540
Kevin Jones: I gotta go. Thanks, y'all.

360
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:04.690
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: like Kevin, that has… that encourages people to build buildings that are fire resilient.

361
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:10.959
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And we've all seen pictures of earthquakes where entire neighborhoods are flattened and one house is still standing.

362
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:18.510
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Or floods, where somebody… you know, there's a community in Florida that survived the hurricane, the last round of hurricanes, completely intact.

363
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:33.720
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Because of their land use planning, sponge, you know, sponge land use, resilient buildings, and so forth. So, there are ways at that. And there's an opportunity for insurance. The precedent was 100 and some odd years ago in Fireman's Fund, which was doing business safety insurance.

364
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:41.009
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Started to provide free safety audits for the businesses they were insuring to come in and show them how to reduce their risk.

365
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:47.980
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: At no cost to the businesses, and, you know, crazy like a fox for Fireman's Fund, because it meant less payouts for damage for them.

366
00:48:47.980 --> 00:49:11.969
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And that's a model that has been, you know, mostly honored in the breach in the industry since then, but there's enormous opportunity for strategic insurance play. Joshua Harrison from the Center for the Study of the Force Major and I and our GPTs are working on some white papers on laying out a different kind of insurance, business-focused insurance industry strategy, whereby companies could do the kind of things we're talking about.

367
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:20.010
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Rather than just saying, oh, no, the calculations say we can't insure you, so we can write off entire states, and screw you. Very different approach.

368
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:33.899
Jerry Michalski: We're going at warp speed, we haven't even hit the hour yet. Why don't we slow down for a second and, take a pause, and I'll bring us back in just a second.

369
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:47.130
Jerry Michalski: just reflecting on the… I'm looking at the chat a little bit, and this conversation, and I'm realizing that

370
00:50:48.610 --> 00:51:01.410
Jerry Michalski: There seem to be, from my amateur perspective, many things we've created as policy, law, regulation that lead to scarcity or break abundance. One of those is zoning.

371
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:09.049
Jerry Michalski: One of those, for example, is we created wilderness areas and national parks where we drove people who understood how to manage the landscape off the land.

372
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.660
Jerry Michalski: We don't, you know, don't let people live in there.

373
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:23.360
Jerry Michalski: Which I think is a mistake. And we're now, in some places, they're reconsidering the mistake and thinking, oh, maybe we should reverse track on that, but it's only a couple hundred years… it's 100 years plus too late.

374
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:31.569
Jerry Michalski: On those things, but it seems like we bake… we make a lot of decisions that aren't based on

375
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:41.060
Jerry Michalski: Rational, systemic thinking. Then we bake those in as laws, and then we, you know, 50 years later, go, gosh, that didn't turn out so well.

376
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.950
Jerry Michalski: And I don't like that we do that as societies.

377
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.590
Jerry Michalski: Klaus, please.

378
00:51:49.270 --> 00:52:02.499
Klaus Mager: Yeah, the conversation just sparked, something. We signed a contract with this group here, the, Archae Generations, and they are headquartered in Kenya, in Nairobi.

379
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:17.729
Klaus Mager: And the intention is to connect, to connect local farmers, groups of local farmers, with resources that are available within the EU, mostly, in mostly EU-funded, but also

380
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:33.389
Klaus Mager: within… within Africa. So they have… they already have 40 locations mapped out in Indonesia, different African states, and a couple of Mediterranean countries. They're providing the AI intelligence.

381
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:47.460
Klaus Mager: technology embedded in their… in their system, and I'm, you know, personally developing a strategic frame on how to engage, but the challenge here really is

382
00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:54.359
Klaus Mager: That, it requires a change in behavior of subsistence farmers

383
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:59.170
Klaus Mager: We have to combine them, first of all, into groups, because…

384
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:18.459
Klaus Mager: a small farmer is just not cost-effective to… to represent in any form or shape, so we are combining groups of farmers into, like, a hundred of them. They are governed by elders. It's a non-hierarchical system. No, it's all circular management structures.

385
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:29.749
Klaus Mager: And by combining them, and then consolidating their behavior, meaning we are developing, a regenerative practice that's, that's…

386
00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:46.870
Klaus Mager: that's the right one for their location and for their markets, meaning the types of crops they're coring, the methods they're using, are going to be uniquely tailored to their particular location. We can then tokenize this, put it in contract forms.

387
00:53:46.880 --> 00:54:04.339
Klaus Mager: tokenize it, and then bring it back to, the, the, European Union inst… agencies, you know, that are, that are distributing these funds. So there's a, there's a pretty disciplined,

388
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:18.200
Klaus Mager: requirement for this entire contracting scheme and for the entire MRV, I mean, measurements, reporting, and values structure that goes with it. But I think the… the…

389
00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:30.670
Klaus Mager: The real challenge is that we have… we are floating, you know, at the theoretical and policy level, with some great ideas, lots of money in there.

390
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:40.419
Klaus Mager: But there is the vertical link missing, you know, how do you… how do you operationalize this, on the ground?

391
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:52.750
Klaus Mager: So we… so the AI system that we now have developed, now it's a 5-agent, system that tracks the entire supply chain from farm to market.

392
00:54:52.750 --> 00:55:02.360
Klaus Mager: And then, then there's a sixth agent, it's the enterprise agent, where we are customizing to a specific location, to, to,

393
00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:10.510
Klaus Mager: To then know, what, what is going on in, in these, in these individual account… accounting groups.

394
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:27.780
Klaus Mager: But that's really, in general, you know, the… it doesn't help to, to… what USAID did, for example, is buy food from American farmers and put it into, subsistence markets.

395
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:35.469
Klaus Mager: That doesn't help, because the moment your food goes away, the whole system collapses, right? There was no attempt

396
00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:43.170
Klaus Mager: To assist these subsistence groups to become self-sufficient and to grow their own food.

397
00:55:43.220 --> 00:56:02.080
Klaus Mager: You know, and to… and so the emphasis is on, let's sell them GMO seeds, which is actually really what happened. You know, Bill Gates all over the place, building synthetic nitrogen fertilizer plants in Africa. So the type of help that was given.

398
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:17.440
Klaus Mager: was really very selfish, you know? I mean, it was… it was not, let's make these guys independent so they can live. So that's, that's, the, the overarching, you know,

399
00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:27.830
Klaus Mager: Strategic intent that we have, you know, is to connect these available resources, you know, with on-the-ground activity.

400
00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:43.670
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Klaus. I've heard some much more positive stories about development aid, because there have been some thorough and eviscerating critiques of development aid. You know, hey, we ship food in and the local farmers can't make a living anymore, etc, etc, but I think that

401
00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:49.950
Jerry Michalski: somewhere in some places, and I don't know who but where, it's more nuanced than that, and they have been trying to teach

402
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:58.270
Jerry Michalski: farmers to, you know, bootstrap farmers to get back into business, etc, etc. I don't… I don't know that it's as vicious as it just sounded from what you just said.

403
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:00.610
Klaus Mager: It is as vicious as I was just saying.

404
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:01.589
Jerry Michalski: Is it that bad?

405
00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:15.340
Klaus Mager: It is horrible. I mean, they destroyed entire landscapes with GMO seeds and synthetic nitrogen. Inserting synthetic nitrogen into the arena was just… I mean, it's just criminal.

406
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:23.959
Klaus Mager: And this is how I've known Bill Gates. And I don't submit bad intentions to someone like Bill Gates. He probably thought he's doing the right thing.

407
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:41.620
Klaus Mager: He's actually embedded, he's a major investor in Monsanto, you know, he's actually embedded with these groups, developing customized high-yield seeds and, you know, their chemical support structure, but it is… it was just devastating. And then… and you're dealing with completely uneducated.

408
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:48.549
Klaus Mager: Subsistence farmers, you know, and you don't have the extensions and all that support.

409
00:57:48.650 --> 00:58:05.629
Klaus Mager: So, no, it's, it's… but Africa is absolutely waking up, you know, to what happened to them, and to make these changes. So, we are actually partnered with the University of Nairobi Extension.

410
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:16.799
Klaus Mager: To, where they are guiding the process and providing us the credentials that we need in order to, you know, be package this, up the chain.

411
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.089
Jerry Michalski: Thank you. Devin, please.

412
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:26.580
Stacey Druss: Muted.

413
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:32.310
Doug Breitbart: just to augment the Bill Gates ironies,

414
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:38.560
Doug Breitbart: So, his big thing was… were these… these nets, mosquito netting.

415
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.950
Doug Breitbart: In service to, you know, addressing the malaria problem.

416
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.999
Doug Breitbart: But as Klaus just mentioned, he's up to his neck in Monsanto.

417
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:58.229
Doug Breitbart: And… A friend of mine, Bernie Krause, who was a bio… Ecological bioacoustician.

418
00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:06.470
Doug Breitbart: You know, pointed out that those chemicals are eradicating.

419
00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:08.110
Doug Breitbart: Amphibians.

420
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.320
Doug Breitbart: products.

421
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.449
Doug Breitbart: Frogs eat mosquitoes.

422
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.219
Doug Breitbart: Like, if you want to go natural systems, and you want to go…

423
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:21.759
Doug Breitbart: Regenerative, and you want to go non-colonial, non-patriarchal, non-capitalist.

424
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.750
Doug Breitbart: And actually speak to needs and problems.

425
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.710
Doug Breitbart: That is not what Bill Gates is in the business of doing.

426
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.159
Doug Breitbart: Or any of them, for that matter.

427
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:39.989
Doug Breitbart: The billionaires, you know, are centered in… their billions are centered in capital.

428
00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:45.169
Doug Breitbart: And everything they do is centered in capital and monopolization of.

429
00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:50.319
Doug Breitbart: Which now extends to food, and GMO seed, and all of it.

430
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:54.029
Doug Breitbart: I wanted to loop back around.

431
00:59:54.540 --> 01:00:00.120
Doug Breitbart: But, Pete, if you wanted to be on this subject, then I'll stop here and come back after you.

432
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:04.230
Doug Breitbart: Because I wanted to loop back around to… Something that was raised.

433
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:05.140
Pete Kaminski: Go ahead, Doug.

434
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:11.330
Doug Breitbart: So… Somebody mentioned, causal loop mapping.

435
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:18.169
Doug Breitbart: And so, I'm… I'm at the genesis point, so this is really early, but,

436
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:27.640
Doug Breitbart: Some of you know Gene Bellinger, who's sort of, you know, the GOAT of causal loop mapping and model making of very complex systems.

437
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:35.060
Doug Breitbart: And… And he did a Klaus with causal loop mapping and AI.

438
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:39.800
Doug Breitbart: And he sort of developed, you know, Version 1 of a…

439
01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:46.160
Doug Breitbart: of an AI template to augment his causal mapping exercise.

440
01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:54.409
Doug Breitbart: And it sort of caught my eye, because… Causal loop mapping…

441
01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:03.270
Doug Breitbart: done properly, human-mediated. This is not automating causal loops analysis, but it's… it…

442
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.739
Doug Breitbart: augmenting it with AI dramatically speeds it up.

443
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:12.199
Doug Breitbart: And also, holds… at the end of the process, holds the… The promise of

444
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:17.170
Doug Breitbart: Surfacing causes and things, variables, that.

445
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:20.179
Doug Breitbart: The person doing the mapping might have missed, but

446
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:28.830
Doug Breitbart: it… because of the volume of data and speed, it makes connections, right? So it can deepen the richness of the output.

447
01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.720
Doug Breitbart: Well, in parallel to that.

448
01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:41.799
Doug Breitbart: I've been working in folks who have frameworks addressing the soft stuff, which is the human, the emotional.

449
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:48.730
Doug Breitbart: Dimensions of people Co-creating together, and also people engaged in dealing with

450
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:59.540
Doug Breitbart: crisis areas and challenges, global challenges. And so… There's a… there's a possibility…

451
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:13.170
Doug Breitbart: to stir into… Gene's causal loop mapping is dealing with nouns, it's dealing with the physical world, it's dealing with, you know, all of the mechanistic Industrial Revolution-oriented ingredients of a system.

452
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:23.019
Doug Breitbart: And… but there's a guy named Bill Smith who has a framework called AIC, Appreciation, Influence, and Control.

453
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:29.290
Doug Breitbart: Which is a rather elaborate framework, but applicable in a very systems-oriented way.

454
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.800
Doug Breitbart: that speaks to… Purpose?

455
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:34.120
Doug Breitbart: and power.

456
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:40.439
Doug Breitbart: So, as an informing inquiry into guiding decision making.

457
01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:43.870
Doug Breitbart: Factoring for those dimensions.

458
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.800
Doug Breitbart: So the balancing act between

459
01:02:47.530 --> 01:03:00.729
Doug Breitbart: Appreciation, which is sort of, you know, the ideal and the goal, the source, the purpose end of it. And then control is the mechanics, and the doing, and the machinery, and the infrastructure, and the what, where, when, why.

460
01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:08.449
Doug Breitbart: So, I believe that framework could be integrated into genes mapping to factor for those dimensions.

461
01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:15.080
Doug Breitbart: So that's piece number two. Piece number three is somebody who we just lost, a guy named Barry Court.

462
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.550
Doug Breitbart: And Barry was unique. He was a systems guy.

463
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:24.140
Doug Breitbart: And one of his things was emotion in education.

464
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:28.810
Doug Breitbart: And he developed a framework for integrating the emotional dimensions.

465
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.800
Doug Breitbart: sort of… Enabling or valuing weighting of them.

466
01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.310
Doug Breitbart: as variable.

467
01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:47.199
Doug Breitbart: framework plugin within other analytical contexts. And I think that could also be integrated into this causal loop mapping. So now we're starting to actually

468
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:58.149
Doug Breitbart: Three-dimensionally, four-dimensionally expand the nature of the inquiry and the analysis in looking at complex system dynamics and what's really going on.

469
01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:06.990
Doug Breitbart: And then, you know, clearly, why? Like, what's all this about? So, Danella Meadows, right, who's known for

470
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:22.100
Doug Breitbart: finding the concept of leverage points. So you have a causal loop map, you know, like, Gene's… one of Gene's greatest, grandest was the Middle East. Like, 5,000 nodes. It was insane and magnificent. But, like, what are the nodes

471
01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.650
Doug Breitbart: That hold the potential.

472
01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.819
Doug Breitbart: For the most impact.

473
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.300
Doug Breitbart: In terms of where do you target?

474
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:34.049
Doug Breitbart: And Donella Meadows sort of surfaced that concept of leverage points.

475
01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:40.550
Doug Breitbart: So… If we could do this richer mapping, factoring for the human and the being dimensions.

476
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:48.490
Doug Breitbart: And we can then identify leverage points, and we can have the output of that provide guidance and insight

477
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:56.430
Doug Breitbart: To inform and enable better decision-making on a policy level, or on a financial and funding and resource level.

478
01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:00.689
Doug Breitbart: Or on a multi-stakeholder level, maximizing across

479
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:05.670
Doug Breitbart: all of those dimensions. You know, Start to have something.

480
01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:10.519
Doug Breitbart: Now, with all of that said, you know, enter yours truly.

481
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:17.129
Doug Breitbart: So, to go to the metaphor of the still picture to motion pictures?

482
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:25.829
Doug Breitbart: So, because of the speed and robustness of AI's capability as an enabling technology, not a source or driver.

483
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:33.109
Doug Breitbart: Now take everything I just said and imagine that as a running process.

484
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.179
Doug Breitbart: With the variable inputs on the front end being real-time.

485
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:44.820
Doug Breitbart: So, it's an exponential leveling up.

486
01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:52.290
Doug Breitbart: Of… and creating a mechanism for a living, real-time causal loop analysis mapping.

487
01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:55.980
Doug Breitbart: Tracking of leverage points, tracking of changes.

488
01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.629
Doug Breitbart: I think it's possible to build this.

489
01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.799
Doug Breitbart: And I'm at the beginning.

490
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.100
Doug Breitbart: And I welcome anybody that wants to, you know.

491
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:18.469
Doug Breitbart: like, sign on and help, because I'm not a… I'm not Pete. Like, I wish I was you, Pete. I'm not you. Like, I'm technology.

492
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:21.039
Jerry Michalski: Alas, none of us has peed, I don't know how that works.

493
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.749
Doug Breitbart: Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm a dude.

494
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:23.940
Jerry Michalski: Only Pete is Pete.

495
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:33.660
Doug Breitbart: You know, I'm a dilett, I'm not, like… I don't… you know, I have a clear vision of the technologies involved in the pieces. I don't think it's that complicated.

496
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:38.620
Doug Breitbart: In terms of anything needing to be invented, it's really about just…

497
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.010
Doug Breitbart: pressing it all into place in service. But anyway…

498
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:46.690
Doug Breitbart: I really think we, you know.

499
01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:58.499
Doug Breitbart: If possible, it would be really great to level up the dimensionality of the inquiry and the analysis, and orientation being brought.

500
01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:00.719
Doug Breitbart: to these contexts.

501
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:05.540
Doug Breitbart: So, I want to end with the last punctuation mark, which is I'm working

502
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:10.259
Doug Breitbart: with a woman named Louise McCullough in Ireland who's focused on

503
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.529
Doug Breitbart: Survivors of domestic abuse in a woman, 30-year-old…

504
01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:24.620
Doug Breitbart: Young lawyer, brilliant woman in, in, Nairobi, same territory, but…

505
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:34.640
Doug Breitbart: Supporting women coming out the back end in entrepreneurial endeavors and community-level support, and intermediating with other aid sources and all the rest.

506
01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:48.100
Doug Breitbart: The woman in Nairobi, Tessie, shared a piece of a puzzle. So she has this nonprofit foundation, she's bootstrapped, she's helping women, she's engaged in rubber meets the road, doing what she's doing.

507
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:55.950
Doug Breitbart: And the problem she shared was that, based on the culture of corruption in Nairobi,

508
01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:09.409
Doug Breitbart: That the women that she's training to be the care provider, you know, benefits caseworker folk in her foundation to the women in the community.

509
01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:19.270
Doug Breitbart: have so much distrust that in her offering to train them to serve the foundation.

510
01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:28.060
Doug Breitbart: they want to know what's in it for her, like, why is she offering them this for free? Like, why is she offering to train them?

511
01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:33.980
Doug Breitbart: As a, as, you know, like, there's nothing free, like, where are the strings?

512
01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:45.960
Doug Breitbart: And I raise that just because what it points to is the weak link is always in humans being human beings.

513
01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:54.719
Doug Breitbart: The weak link is that people are people, they're not machinery, they're not parts of a machine, they're not cogs.

514
01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:02.290
Doug Breitbart: And the soft dimensions, the cultural dimensions, the fear and belief and deprivation and trauma dimensions.

515
01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:04.679
Doug Breitbart: Make or break it?

516
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:09.739
Doug Breitbart: And 85-90% of everything that exists today

517
01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:15.589
Doug Breitbart: Doesn't even acknowledge they exist, much less recognize that they're the leverage point.

518
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:21.409
Doug Breitbart: And I apologize for the length of that run, but, I'm complete.

519
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.920
Jerry Michalski: Excellent. Thanks, Doug.

520
01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.110
Jerry Michalski: Got a lot of things in the room, appreciate that.

521
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.620
Jerry Michalski: P…

522
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:43.069
Pete Kaminski: That was great, Doug. No need for an apology. And hit me up about the Causal Loop, mealtime thingy. That sounds fun.

523
01:09:43.950 --> 01:10:01.149
Pete Kaminski: I… since we're on the topic of abundance and… and… and maybe, in a way, kind of the indigestion, that comes… seems to come from it, or… or, lack of, lack of appropriate distribution or something.

524
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:15.489
Pete Kaminski: I wanted to make a shout out… I wish Ken were here to say this instead of me. I want to make a shout out to Hospicing Modernity, the book by Vanessa Andrealdi. If you haven't seen it, she approaches the

525
01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:24.620
Pete Kaminski: the thing that we're in, the thing that we've built. She calls it… the longer title, the longer name she's got for it is Modernity Slash Coloniality.

526
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:29.459
Pete Kaminski: She approaches modeling where we are.

527
01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:47.530
Pete Kaminski: and then what to think about it, and what to do with that without paralysis in a way that is different from anything else I've seen. And so, if you haven't seen it, I think you owe yourself a deep look at, you know, the approach that she's got.

528
01:10:49.060 --> 01:11:00.969
Pete Kaminski: And Ken doesn't have a lot of time in his life, I think, right now, because he's starting to move, but Ken is kind of a central resource for me in finding out more about the book, and we've got some of us doing…

529
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:06.879
Pete Kaminski: some inquiry about it, partly through Signal and other places.

530
01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.910
Pete Kaminski: So, that's kind of it.

531
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:13.560
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Rach.

532
01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.940
Jerry Michalski: We're having abundant thoughts about abundance.

533
01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:27.169
Jerry Michalski: Any other perspectives? You want to bring some other… some other angle on the question in?

534
01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:40.859
Jerry Michalski: I keep coming back to the notion that consumerism creates the illusion of abundance, that has been…

535
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.579
Jerry Michalski: Entrancing for many people.

536
01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:46.060
Jerry Michalski: There, there are…

537
01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:52.369
Jerry Michalski: I'm using videos on YouTube of North Koreans, or people who grew up in the Soviet Union.

538
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:57.509
Jerry Michalski: coming to an American hypermarket, or some other thing, and just seeing

539
01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:02.329
Jerry Michalski: How much stuff there is. How much… how much stuff is available?

540
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:12.650
Jerry Michalski: I haven't been in a department store for a while, but last few times I went through, like, the women's… women's… I used to go shopping with my mom a bunch.

541
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:32.329
Jerry Michalski: And, you know, the women's clothing areas are just endless racks, and I look around, I'm like, hmm, wouldn't wear that, wouldn't wear that, wouldn't like to wear that, that looks ugly. Oh my god, what happened there? And just acres and acres and acres of stuff out, in the hope that somebody will pick it up and take it home and buy it with money.

542
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:40.580
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, please. Stacy, has your cynicism heightened or dampened a little bit with the call?

543
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.340
Stacey Druss: Well, that's actually what my comment's about.

544
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:52.329
Stacey Druss: So, I recognize that my cynicism may be a result that, from an energetic point of view.

545
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.380
Stacey Druss: I am actually where Trump Begin.

546
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.860
Stacey Druss: I am at the heart

547
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:17.489
Stacey Druss: of where he began, where consumerism is, where capitalism is. I'm in New York City. I know his type, I know the types of the people that surround him, probably more than most of you in this room. I also know types like you.

548
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:30.980
Stacey Druss: But I grew up around the types of people that he grew up around, on all different economic levels, so that could have a piece of it. Because, as I've said many times, I can get into his mindset.

549
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:41.559
Stacey Druss: The difference is, I have a different morality and a different set of ethics, which, as we've noted many times, doesn't work as well to be successful in business.

550
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:47.089
Stacey Druss: So now to get back to the trust piece of it, and the leverage points.

551
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.350
Stacey Druss: I've consistently, because I'm in the soft space.

552
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:59.100
Stacey Druss: I'm working on building trust and building bridges. And that's where Romeo comes in. Romeo is the guy on my lap.

553
01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:04.900
Stacey Druss: Romeo came to me because, last week in a NIAC

554
01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:14.309
Stacey Druss: space, a call came out, an urgent need for temporary foster care for this adorable little dog.

555
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:32.059
Stacey Druss: And you guys know how much Marley meant to me, and people keep saying, are you gonna get another dog? And as much as I loved Marley, I didn't want the responsibility. I'm loving my life. I'm out 5 nights a week, I'm on the music scene, I'm independent, I'm like a teenager. I like it.

556
01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:38.649
Stacey Druss: But I knew this dog was for me, because nobody's gonna take care of him better than I can.

557
01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:41.119
Stacey Druss: Well, here's the story of Romeo.

558
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:48.819
Stacey Druss: Romeo's father was picked up by ICE as he was dropping his kids off at camp.

559
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.009
Stacey Druss: And because he was the sole provider.

560
01:14:52.630 --> 01:15:01.120
Stacey Druss: His wife and children no longer have a home. So until they can find their home, That accepts dogs.

561
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.529
Stacey Druss: I'm taking care of Romeo.

562
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.110
Stacey Druss: Now, in my town.

563
01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:11.400
Stacey Druss: me and Romeo go out and meet people, the way me and Marley used to meet people.

564
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:18.189
Stacey Druss: And he's become the ambassador. So I make sure, because I can usually get a sense of where somebody is

565
01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:21.359
Stacey Druss: In their heart space, let's say.

566
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:32.409
Stacey Druss: And so, people that may not have had compassion or empathy for Romeo's family, have total compassion for Romeo.

567
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:38.599
Stacey Druss: They also get A different way of looking at the situation.

568
01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.010
Stacey Druss: So, I mean, you might find it amusing if you know who Curtis Sliwa is.

569
01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.470
Stacey Druss: I call him, misogynist.

570
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:56.919
Stacey Druss: Four-time married vigilante liar, but that's just me. But he's now campaigning for animal rights.

571
01:15:57.290 --> 01:16:07.410
Stacey Druss: Which confirms to me what I already knew, that these people actually love animals, or many of them, at least the ones that criss-cross do.

572
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:21.700
Stacey Druss: Anyway, the point I'm trying to make, what was the point, is this is Romeo, and he's going to be with me for a while, and hopefully I'll take some time to write something up on Facebook, because that's the world I play in. So, Gil, to your point.

573
01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.830
Stacey Druss: Those people know me.

574
01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:26.719
Stacey Druss: I've been speaking there for 10 years.

575
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:33.319
Stacey Druss: And whether they like me or hate me, for the most part, the people that know me

576
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:44.150
Stacey Druss: They know that what I'm saying is me. I am true to my character. So whether you like my character or you hate my character, you can trust my character.

577
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:47.600
Stacey Druss: So… For me, it's a matter of trust.

578
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.109
Stacey Druss: Thank you.

579
01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.760
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Stacey.

580
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:55.740
Jerry Michalski: Alex.

581
01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.269
Alex Kladitis: I'm gonna move slightly away from everything you've said, so…

582
01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:04.579
Alex Kladitis: Jess, if you're still on track with this path.

583
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.330
Alex Kladitis: Would you like to speak first, rather than…

584
01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:10.760
Alex Kladitis: Me, kind of, derailing the conversation somewhat.

585
01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:17.010
Jessie Upp: No, I wanted to kind of more converge everyone together, so I will go more at the end. Thank you.

586
01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:19.840
Alex Kladitis: Okay, let me scatter them, then, in the first place.

587
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.950
Jerry Michalski: Cool.

588
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:27.379
Alex Kladitis: It's very interesting what you've said, and for me, for my mind, the way my mind works, it's all very interesting, and…

589
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:32.050
Alex Kladitis: The thing that I always think about, though, I live in a world of…

590
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:39.470
Alex Kladitis: my mental picture of the world, I should say, is one of special interests doing their thing.

591
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:42.419
Alex Kladitis: Bigger special interest is, of course, capitalism.

592
01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:50.009
Alex Kladitis: And it pushes and drives In a way that says abundance is…

593
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:56.070
Alex Kladitis: A lot of everything that, as a lot of you have said, is not really needed.

594
01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:07.139
Alex Kladitis: And trying to convince people to step back, even if you try and convince 5 people to step back, there's another million over there doing whatever we don't want them to do, because it's…

595
01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:09.320
Alex Kladitis: Wasting resources, etc.

596
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.829
Alex Kladitis: And I just wonder, the way you think, it's actually a question for you guys, is…

597
01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:18.589
Alex Kladitis: We're talking about it, we're saying the right things, and believe the right things.

598
01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:24.289
Alex Kladitis: But how are we going to change anything other than talking about the right things? You know, is it sort of…

599
01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:28.199
Alex Kladitis: There's too few of us, there's too few across the world.

600
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:34.829
Alex Kladitis: And this is a systemic thing, that's all I always keep going on about, is the systemic things are pushing in.

601
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:44.030
Alex Kladitis: And, you know, at the back of my mind, I think, if you take the Amish as a subculture, sorry, if I use the wrong word, I apologize.

602
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:45.650
Alex Kladitis: Whatever they are.

603
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:50.269
Alex Kladitis: And then… but there… there's a few of those sort of communities that are…

604
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.360
Alex Kladitis: A living on the benefit of everybody else.

605
01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:57.140
Alex Kladitis: Accepting them, that they are as they are, but…

606
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:59.540
Alex Kladitis: They're being nurtured, in a way.

607
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:07.110
Alex Kladitis: And that's not how the real world works, and how are we gonna change that without being dictatorial about it?

608
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:13.659
Alex Kladitis: It's just your thoughts, I don't think we're going to change it, but… Anybody have any?

609
01:19:17.690 --> 01:19:18.660
Jerry Michalski: Thanks, Alex.

610
01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:25.699
Jerry Michalski: If you have suggestions or answers for Alex, climb in the queue, please. Let's go to Jesse.

611
01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:36.330
Jessie Upp: Great question, I think I, you know, we're asking that every day of ourselves, and…

612
01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:46.199
Jessie Upp: And in order to unify and change… be the change I wish to see in this call, in this community of Jerry's and all us.

613
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.640
Jessie Upp: I have continuously tried to map

614
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.200
Jessie Upp: The intelligence in this room? It's incredible.

615
01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:58.169
Jessie Upp: We have 9 people on the OGM room,

616
01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:06.520
Jessie Upp: Stacy doesn't really, you know, she wanted to have a virtual room that's open 24-7. I created that. It's available, Stacy, let's connect.

617
01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.630
Stacey Druss: I don't want a virtual room, though, I'm sorry.

618
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:28.179
Jessie Upp: Well, this is a virtual room, you and me, right here in this call, and so I would love to create conversation, because I believe that answer that you just raised is born out of community. It depends on which community you're in, so if you're in a local-based community, that answer's different than if you're in an OGM community.

619
01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:32.209
Jessie Upp: So, depending on who you're with, that answer emerges.

620
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:46.910
Jessie Upp: So, I loved the prompt at the beginning of this call, and the questions were answered based on different life stages, different consciousness levels, different needs.

621
01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.570
Jessie Upp: And…

622
01:20:48.930 --> 01:21:05.350
Jessie Upp: And we're just kind of resonating with the world, as we all have different perspectives and different needs, but if we wanted to start honing in and converging at least just this community, and see where those touchpoints are, and as Doug was bringing up.

623
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:13.530
Jessie Upp: let's go. I am ready with… to… to soar here, because, talking is one thing, and… and,

624
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.720
Jessie Upp: And converging and acting is another, so…

625
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:31.850
Jessie Upp: I'll put in the link again. And Stacy, you and I, let's talk afterwards and figure out what would work for you, because I want to serve you, and how you are… you are amazing in community, and I want to… I want your inspiration to be, a seed.

626
01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.290
Stacey Druss: Thank you.

627
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:34.329
Stacey Druss: Can I just reset?

628
01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:36.349
Jerry Michalski: Yes, yes, please.

629
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.309
Stacey Druss: Yeah, let me explain.

630
01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:50.550
Stacey Druss: This community has served me. This is the virtual world. So, Jesse, what your… what you created, that's to serve others. I already felt, like…

631
01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:59.750
Stacey Druss: it's… it's almost like going back… what you're doing, and what I hope I inspired you to create, is deconstructing

632
01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.900
Stacey Druss: what I already lived into.

633
01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:19.400
Stacey Druss: If that makes sense. So, I don't want to go and find a new virtual world to play in. I'm actually leaving the virtual world. I spent yesterday with Romeo sitting outside the club that I usually go to.

634
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:33.299
Stacey Druss: talking to people. Somebody sat and was telling me about his memories coming up about 9-11. Somebody who's more towards the right. And I got to sit with them and talk to them and be in the world.

635
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:33.720
Jessie Upp: Yeah.

636
01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:40.600
Stacey Druss: So, my journey's a little different. I am different, so I don't want you to take it the wrong way.

637
01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.460
Stacey Druss: I'm unique.

638
01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.890
Stacey Druss: But I… but I love that virtual world, but this was it for me.

639
01:22:47.270 --> 01:23:11.279
Jessie Upp: Stacy, we're actually talking about the same thing, because I'm trying to get people off the virtual world, into their community, into their place-based, so I'm going to put this link in here. Based on Dunbar research, it shows that we only need about 50 people in our lives that we are committed to, and they're committed to us… I mean, they're committed to us, and there's reciprocation, and if that is there, in a place-based or digital, you… you decide.

640
01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:27.930
Jessie Upp: We can thrive. It shows, based on research, we can thrive in smaller communities. And so, let's talk about that a little bit more, but it's all about getting back into our… into our community. If it's place-based, yes, for sure.

641
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.459
Stacey Druss: what I would just say is, find the people first.

642
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:38.930
Stacey Druss: Yes. And then use those spaces to coordinate. But find the people that you want to spend time with.

643
01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.090
Stacey Druss: That's the key, that you want lift.

644
01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:47.910
Jessie Upp: That's the link I just put in there, so thank you. And 42 is the meaning of life, so that's why 42.

645
01:23:49.030 --> 01:24:01.629
Jerry Michalski: Cool, thank you. Thank you both. Before going to class, I just want to ask us to use the chat to answer Jesse's challenge. It's like, hey, what kinds of things might we engage in together?

646
01:24:01.890 --> 01:24:10.820
Jerry Michalski: That would be juicy for you, that, we, the people in this group listening to this call right this second, this we, the very, very local we.

647
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:13.620
Jerry Michalski: And one thing I'm interested in is.

648
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:26.259
Jerry Michalski: doing something provocative to tease, cajole, poke-provoke the insurance companies. Like, I'm, like, a little tired, little tired of them not stepping up and helping change the world, shape the world for the good.

649
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:32.600
Jerry Michalski: In some way, and I would love to do something provocative, for the insurance company, so…

650
01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:50.859
Jerry Michalski: ping me if you'd like to play with that together, and maybe there's something there. But I bet there's a bunch of other things that have been in our minds that if we share them into the chat, we might find two, three people who want to get together and do things, and then go off and do them. That would be great. And if you do any of that, come back and tell us about it later.

651
01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.089
Jerry Michalski: Klaus, thank you for your patience.

652
01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:07.160
Klaus Mager: Yeah, along the same lines as Jesse was just outlining, and Stacy, I like the, neighborhoods of sanity concept,

653
01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:17.869
Klaus Mager: What is really happening in the regenerative movement right now is a concept someone else described as islands of coherence.

654
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:29.509
Klaus Mager: So the real… the realization that we can't spread lateral, you know, and boil the ocean, so to speak, you have to take one community at a time.

655
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:41.710
Klaus Mager: And the reason why… why that is so important is because we are, on the one hand, talking at the narrative level, right? Storylines. And so we are creating stories of change, of transition.

656
01:25:41.990 --> 01:26:00.440
Klaus Mager: But then Donila Meadows comes to mind, right? The pyramid of a system where, yes, you have the narrative level that really… that really condenses the story, but then that same narrative has to stay intact as it rolls

657
01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:18.910
Klaus Mager: down the pyramid, or I really call it an inverted pyramid, right? Because the narrative is at the base, and it's holding up the entire pyramid. So as you go through those layers, you know, through the administrative part, the operational part, that story has to stay intact.

658
01:26:19.210 --> 01:26:30.429
Klaus Mager: and motivate and direct, you know, the action of people in that community. So that really takes…

659
01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:41.429
Klaus Mager: you know, a transition, you know, it takes a convergence, you know, of many different layers there. And so.

660
01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:54.539
Klaus Mager: I'm… you know, I'm working with spiral dynamics, so when we go into the base layers of this pyramid.

661
01:26:54.860 --> 01:27:05.940
Klaus Mager: That's when you are operating in blue, right? People who are, in… in… like, Mike Johnson is the epitome of blue, the Speaker of the House.

662
01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:20.639
Klaus Mager: So that's a different language, and that language is actually… has been evolving over, you know, 2,000 years. That's New Testament language that gets you into the hearts and minds of people who are operating in that layer.

663
01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:27.870
Klaus Mager: So, we shouldn't hesitate, you know, to… because it's religion and all this stuff.

664
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:39.849
Klaus Mager: We shouldn't hesitate to use that language in order to reach out, because that's the world that, you know, this group has been embedded in.

665
01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:48.399
Klaus Mager: and grew up in, you know, through Sunday school and, you know, Bible studies and all of this stuff. That's the language they understand.

666
01:27:48.430 --> 01:28:01.099
Klaus Mager: So we can make… we have metaphors that are instantly, recognizable and… and… and resonate, yeah? And… and I think there is… there is this…

667
01:28:02.890 --> 01:28:14.529
Klaus Mager: note this translation where there's a lot of knee-jerk reactions of, you know, I can't use this, this is childish, or this is whatever. No, this is the language of people you're trying to reach.

668
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:25.250
Klaus Mager: You know, and, and so, so, why not, why not, why not, you know, use it to its fullest? And there's a hunger right now.

669
01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:37.079
Klaus Mager: Now, you can… you can see in the pop… you can see these often misguided attempts to bring religion into the… into the conversation.

670
01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:42.370
Klaus Mager: But in the way it's done, it's more exploitative than supportive, yeah?

671
01:28:42.420 --> 01:29:01.360
Klaus Mager: So… so there, there are pockets of, of, like this one congressperson in Texas who is a pastor, you know, wonderfully articulate, and he is… is unafraid and… and unintimidated to use biblical language to address his voters.

672
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:10.269
Klaus Mager: Yeah? And… and so that's… I think we… this is… this is… this… we have to change minds, we have to change narratives.

673
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:29.630
Klaus Mager: No, we have to change stories. And we are pretty much consolidated on the story we have at the top. I mean, amongst ourselves here, you know, the story is pretty clear what it should be, where we should be going, and so on. That this is not the challenge. The challenge is to translate this story.

674
01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:36.059
Klaus Mager: Right? So it echoes in the different layers of this pyramid, in each… in each phase of them.

675
01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:38.399
Klaus Mager: Sorry, didn't mean to preach.

676
01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:50.600
Jerry Michalski: That's all right. Thanks, Klaus. I just noticed we're coming up on the end of our time. Klaus, you may have the last word. We have no Serkan Homer with us today, but I think I've found a poem that I would like to read in.

677
01:29:50.710 --> 01:29:51.890
Jerry Michalski: as our clothes.

678
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.269
Jerry Michalski: So Gil, off to you.

679
01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:04.990
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Sorry, I thought you were giving Klaus the last word. Just very briefly, Klaus, I appreciate very much what you're saying, and I want to just flag a contradiction in what I heard of what you're saying.

680
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:20.390
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Which is about understanding people's language and speaking to them in that, but that can be manipulative, you said, I think. And exploitative. So there's a challenge there of how to do that that centers the listening more than the speaking.

681
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:31.660
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Like, how do I engage with somebody who's in a very different language and worldview than me, so that we can understand each other, different than me learning how to use their language so I can get them to do what they want?

682
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:39.540
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Because that sort of re-recapitulates the same problem, so… and it's a delicate dance to do that.

683
01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:54.009
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: But I think that's what you're pointing to, and you flagged the contradiction. I just wanted to highlight that, that, you know, I've heard a quote somewhere that I thought it was attributed to Gandhi, but I can't find it anywhere. But somebody once told me that all persuasion is violence.

684
01:30:54.750 --> 01:31:01.310
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: And it's, you know, it's an extreme statement, it's provocative, but there's something, for me, very generative in thinking into that.

685
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:10.529
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: How do I meet minds with other people and find better common purpose together without trying to bend them to my will?

686
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:12.070
Klaus Mager: Yeah, no.

687
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.450
Jerry Michalski: Perfect.

688
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:15.199
Klaus Mager: Listening. Who is one loss, right?

689
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:17.200
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Jerry, thank you.

690
01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:28.519
Jerry Michalski: You mentioned… I think you brought this up on the call of, 828, and I looked it up, and the closest I got was Sally Miller Gearhart.

691
01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:31.199
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Close enough for me, I love it. Thank you so much.

692
01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:37.230
Jerry Michalski: Yeah, that was my best tracking. Pete can probably do better than me on this, but

693
01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:41.070
Jerry Michalski: Just saying, I'm not… I'm just a yellow belt.

694
01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.219
Jerry Michalski: on there.

695
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:43.330
Jerry Michalski: comments?

696
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:50.179
Jerry Michalski: Stacy, you're gonna have the last word. I'm sorry. Which seems somehow appropriate, because you have the opening sound, too.

697
01:31:50.180 --> 01:32:07.049
Stacey Druss: I know you wanted… I think… I just think this is an appropriate story for this last interaction. So, in a conversation with my mother, who voted for Trump 3 times, she's very old, you know, she's old, she's, you know, we're going through our last things.

698
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:11.399
Stacey Druss: She was very upset, I'm trying to calm her down, I don't want to fight with her.

699
01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:26.709
Stacey Druss: Now, I'm Jewish. We had no religious training. I'm actually the only one that ever… I mean, my father was bar mitzvahed because his family, you know, did that. They were Democrats, they had Kennedy in their house. My mother's right, she was all Uncle Sam.

700
01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:40.779
Stacey Druss: So she's kept talking to me. She's always… she always… she sounds… it has to… she sounds like an evangelical. She's always talking about the Lord, the Lord, the Lord. So she was worried about something, so I said, Mom, let's… let's pray together.

701
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:46.549
Stacey Druss: So… but I prayed to her, and I was calling in Gaia.

702
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:57.799
Stacey Druss: And anyway, she got very upset with me, and I forgot why I brought up the story, but it had to do with the language. Oh, and that's what it was. It was the delicate dance.

703
01:32:57.890 --> 01:33:07.419
Stacey Druss: Because even though I was using what she kept saying about prayer and how important prayer was, now I was willing to

704
01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:08.850
Stacey Druss: Pray with her.

705
01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:16.809
Stacey Druss: And, you know, I said, you know, call upon grandma, and, you know, we call… and she believes in that, too. She really does.

706
01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:22.780
Stacey Druss: But it was just very interesting, because when I wasn't going in the direction she wanted.

707
01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:32.849
Stacey Druss: She got very, very angry. And that's what happens when you use somebody's own language, and we saw that with Charlie Kirk. When people used his own words.

708
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:38.019
Stacey Druss: People can get really angry, so it is a delicate dance, because

709
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:43.659
Stacey Druss: When you're dealing at a certain level of purposely trying to not be aware.

710
01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:49.610
Stacey Druss: all the… all the emotions come out to push you away. So…

711
01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:54.969
Stacey Druss: This wasn't the most articulate way to explain it, but it's a starting point for another conversation.

712
01:33:55.430 --> 01:34:00.589
Jerry Michalski: Thank you, Stacey. And you're reminding me a belated Shanatava to those who celebrate.

713
01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.210
Jerry Michalski: Happy New Year.

714
01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.519
Stacey Druss: T. Thank you.

715
01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.869
Jerry Michalski: Thanks.

716
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:19.630
Jerry Michalski: Doug, thank you very much. I… the poem that, I will now read is by Cheshwave Miwash, I think that's how to pronounce his name. It's titled Love.

717
01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.930
Jerry Michalski: And it goes as follows.

718
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:30.939
Jerry Michalski: Love means to learn to look at yourself, the way one looks at distant things, for you are only one thing among many.

719
01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:37.290
Jerry Michalski: And whoever sees that way heals his heart without knowing it from various ills.

720
01:34:37.730 --> 01:34:40.109
Jerry Michalski: A bird and a tree say hi to him.

721
01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:41.410
Jerry Michalski: Trent.

722
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:47.209
Jerry Michalski: Then, he wants to use himself and things so that they stand in the glow of ripeness.

723
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:54.760
Jerry Michalski: It doesn't matter whether he knows what he serves, Who serves best, Doesn't always understand.

724
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:56.030
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Hmm.

725
01:34:58.530 --> 01:34:59.909
Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach: Can you read it again, Sherry.

726
01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:00.970
Jerry Michalski: Sure.

727
01:35:04.170 --> 01:35:06.909
Jerry Michalski: Love means to learn to look at yourself.

728
01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.519
Jerry Michalski: The way one looks at distant things.

729
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:12.509
Jerry Michalski: For you are only one thing among many.

730
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:18.330
Jerry Michalski: And whoever sees that way heals his heart, without knowing it, from various ills.

731
01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:21.880
Jerry Michalski: A bird in the tree say to him, Friend.

732
01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:26.010
Jerry Michalski: Then he wants to use himself and things.
